"""
Deletes all vulnerabilities reported by Machine
for method cfn_iam_is_role_over_privileged of Finding 325,
because the method was migrated to F165. Additionally, this method on F165
and a method on F031 were reporting the same cardinility, so both methods had
their logic adjusted to avoid duplication.
For this reason, this migration also executes F031 and F165 for the groups
that had vulns deleted to confirm.

Execution Time:    2022-12-13 at 12:32:01 UTC
Finalization Time: 2022-12-13 at 12:34:38 UTC

The migration was re-executed because the machine vulns were not correctly
filtered. Only the source is not enough, so hacker email was added as option.

Details of second execution:
