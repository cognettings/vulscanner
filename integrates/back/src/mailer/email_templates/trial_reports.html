          Organizations need flexibility with vulnerabilitiesâ€™ data.
          In our Fluid Attacks' Platform, you can download several reports
          giving you exactly this.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance: you can download a technical report, in XLSX format,
          where you can define what to download,
          instead of downloading everything (which is the default option)
        </p>

          Bear in mind that you need to register your mobile phone number
          to download the reports.
