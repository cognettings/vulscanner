Organizations need their cybersecurity strategy
to suit their current threat landscape,
lest they end up allocating their resources
to ineffective solutions.
A proper way to verify good decisions are being made
in this regard
is reviewing whether the company's technology,
ongoing projects and roadmap cover the tactics,
techniques and procedures factually targeting their assets.
A feature of [Lumu's platform](https://portal.lumu.io/account/sign-up)
facilitates exactly that
by aligning actual incidents in a company's network
with the corresponding entries of the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.
This allows organizations to learn
whether they are spending their resources
on managing the true ways a malicious actor can get in.
Importantly,
they can also identify which scenarios should be present
in continuous red teaming and penetration testing processes
such as those provided by Fluid Attacks.

## Knowing your threat landscape

Are you sure
your organization's cybersecurity spending is not being wasted?
Today,
there is an overabundance of tools and service categories.
Some companies believe the more tools they use,
the more secure their systems are,
so their budget goes to a lot of products.
But when asked,
a significant number admits that
they still struggle with effective remediation.
We believe they could prevent this
by allowing ethical hackers to probe systems continuously
to find the actual biggest risks
before malicious hackers do.
But the possibility exists
that a breach to their systems might have already happened
before implementing this approach
and that it might even have gone unnoticed
for hundreds of days.
After all,
companies worldwide are targeted by attackers hundreds of times daily.

Incidents and results of manual security testing
provide evidence of what your system is up against in the wild.
The facts learned
can give you a pretty good idea of what you should spend more on.
So,
a helpful solution should be able to get information on risks
from several fronts,
organize it for better analysis
and allow for identification of areas
where defenses should be prioritized.
One such solution is offered by the cybersecurity firm Lumu.
Their platform,
Lumu Portal,
is a single pane of glass
where the user can manage continuous compromise assessments
and access the generated reports
and related contextual intelligence.

Basically,
Lumu's solution runs continuously,
looking for actual or potential exposure of the confidentiality,
integrity or availability of IT systems
or the information in them.
On the platform,
you can see the connections attempted
from your organization's devices
toward adversarial infrastructure,
which devices are controlled by threat actors,
traces of adversarial contact in logs,
and phishing attempts,
among other things.
Lumu characterizes all these attacks
through the [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)
(adversarial tactics, techniques and common knowledge)
framework.

## Mapping incidents to the ATT&CK framework

The ATT&CK framework is a knowledge base
that helps people understand
how malicious threat actors behave.
Relating the incidents in the assessed organization's network
with entries in this framework
allows for the classification of attacker activity
through a shared language.
On the Lumu Portal,
each incident has its own matrix
showing which tactics are related to it.
Further,
users can see the actionable steps
from Lumu's incident response playbooks
based on controls suggested by the NIST
(National Institute of Standards and Technology).

Since organizations need to know
where they should exert the most effort,
the platform also gives them an overall view
of how attackers are targeting the networks.
It does so in its [MITRE ATT&CK® Global Matrix](https://docs.lumu.io/portal/en/kb/articles/mitre-attack-global-matrix),
which shows all the detected incidents
in a chosen time frame organized by incidence.

The following are clear benefits
to having the information provided by the matrix:

- Understanding,
  based on actual evidence,
  where the budget should go
  and what issues should be prioritized.

- Learning which defenses need improvement
  to effectively protect against offenses
  from the organization's actual threat landscape.

- Identifying which assets attackers are targeting and how.
  This allows the firm
  to continually assess the effectiveness of its security testing scheme
  and make informed decisions
  to improve security testing scenarios.

With these three benefits,
which also represent use cases,
companies can ask themselves
whether they are covering tactics,
techniques and procedures with their technology,
ongoing projects or roadmap.

It is worth noting that
the second benefit mentioned above is closely related
to the Threat-Informed Defense (TID) strategy,
which can be operationalized
with the help of Lumu's [MITRE ATT&CK Global Matrix](https://docs.lumu.io/portal/en/kb/articles/mitre-attack-global-matrix),
as Julian Brown recently [noted in a blog post](https://lumu.io/blog/threat-informed-defense).
There,
Jon Baker,
co-founder and director of the [Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/),
is quoted saying that
"implementing a \[TID\] starts with understanding the threats
that are relevant to your organization
and then aligning your defenses to those threats."

## Prioritize the right techniques in security testing

Ideally an organization should secure its systems completely.
Despite this,
prioritization helps concentrate efforts,
knowledge and resources
in the areas that represent the most risk.
This involves requesting attack simulations
that recreate actual incidents
that happen the most in the firm's networks.
In these simulations,
ethical hackers employ the same techniques
that attackers possibly used in such incidents.

By setting up your permanent [Lumu Free account](https://portal.lumu.io/account/sign-up),
you will be allowed to run assessments
to understand your systems' compromise level.
Then,
you can upgrade to Lumu's paid offerings
to get the most out of the solution,
including access to the MITRE ATT&CK Global Matrix.
Its information will allow you to prioritize the techniques
in security testing
that will be more effective for your organization.

When choosing your cybersecurity testing strategy,
remember you should not rely on automated security testing alone.
Tools cannot imitate today's threat actors accurately
and have high rates of false positives and false negatives.
At Fluid Attacks,
we encourage companies to let ethical hackers simulate attacks
against their digital assets' defenses.
And these simulations should be conducted continuously.
When they are done only every once in a while,
they do not truly suit organizations' needs
in an ever-evolving threat environment.
That's why we offer [Continuous Hacking](../../services/continuous-hacking/),
which you can [try for free for 21 days](https://app.fluidattacks.com/SignUp).
Our most comprehensive offering includes continuous manual work
by our highly certified ethical hackers
in [pentesting](../../solutions/penetration-testing/)
and [red teaming](../../solutions/red-teaming/) operations.
