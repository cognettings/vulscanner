Data leakage is a daily occurrence phenomenon,
or at least that's what I've read about.
Lists of user/password pairs are stolen
from various places on the Internet.
Those mountains of information are then offered
and sold in the '[dark web](../dark-web).'
They are the required resources to be used in *Credential Stuffing*,
the kind of attack we're going to discuss
in this post.

This form of attack consists of the large-scale automation
of login attempts on chosen websites,
hoping that any of them will be successful
in gaining access to a user account
and then violate their privacy,
act on their behalf or steal from them.
In addition to the lists
of usually thousands of user/password pairs to be tested,
also called *Combo lists* or just *Combos*,
it is necessary to possess software
that works for the cybercriminal
in an automated way.

Thus,
contrary to what the attackers have to do in [Password Cracking](../pass-cracking/),
in this case,
they don't have to guess passwords.
They already have at their disposal the credentials
to be tested.
It seems to be a piece of cake,
as well as something effective,
especially when people have the naive habit
of using the same passwords
on different websites or applications.
So,
the attacker doesn't have to be a hacker;
they could be just [script kiddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie)
to perform credential stuffing.

The skilled hackers are those that,
exploiting vulnerabilities,
can steal and decrypt the databases of credentials.
They then decide
if they give them away to the world
or offer and sell them in closed communities.
The more recent the leaked combo,
the more valuable it can be for anyone interested
in this kind of crime.

So,
once the script kiddies have access
to a usually big list of credentials,
they need a program that works for them.
It will check every user
and its corresponding password
against a previously selected web application
(without knowing if they will achieve anything there)
to identify those that successfully log in.
If there's a match with an existing account,
we can say that this one has been cracked.
The tool would save that user/password pair
along with the others
that were also successful in the combo.
From there,
the attackers would proceed according to their purposes.

## What about tools?

Nowadays,
although some experienced crackers use their scripts,
there are tools
(seemingly not free)
exclusively designed for credential stuffing.
We can easily find tips and tutorials
on how to use them on the Internet.
Some of the most popular programs are **Sentry MBA** and **STORM**.
However,
more recently,
**SNIPR** has emerged with similar functionalities,
but apparently with greater stability
and a more intuitive interface.

The tools to employ in this kind of attack
should have the ability to bypass diverse security mechanisms.
For example,
*some* websites have protection against massive login attempts
from the same IP address.
This behavior tends to be suspicious
and associated with cracking by the web application's owners.
That's why in these cases,
the credential stuffing tool usually incorporates lists of proxies
that simulate requests from several sites on the Internet,
thus ensuring anonymity and non-stop automation.

</div>

Even with proxies,
large numbers of login requests
in short periods can draw attention
(though not always).
Here's when the mature and patient attackers
(not desperate teenagers)
can perform slow credential stuffing
with few requests for a day.
However,
it could take months for them
to test thousands of pairs of the combo list.
That gives time for users to change their passwords
and make those leaked databases lose value.

Having a combo list,
a tool, and proxies,
the attackers commonly need to find and buy configurations or plugins
to attack particular web applications or websites.
The programs have some of them for free,
but skilled hackers cleverly have built an additional market
where they offer and sell other plugins
to those attackers who have no idea how to make them.
That's another way for them to make a profit.

## Any recommendation for prevention?

### For users

Do not reuse passwords.
Try to make sure that
there are marked differences between the passwords you use.
Modify them continuously and in a creative way.
You can create patterns for helping your memory,
but I don't mean just adding intuitive prefixes or suffixes.
It'd be something like passphrases
with words you easily remember,
with peculiar variations for each account,
not forgetting the use of any symbols,
numbers and capital letters.
Of course,
you can use password managers
like [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
when you think there are many passwords to remember and keep safe.

### For web application managers

First of all,
give the previous paragraph's advice to your users
(do you *know* them? You should).
Additionally,
check their passwords against those
that have appeared in known breaches.
You can use [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
and lists like the [top 1000 leaked](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000.txt)
to identify publicly exposed credentials,
and although they are not the most recent data,
they can serve as a warning to your users.

Regarding login requests,
it is foolish not to pay attention to the user traffic
and login trends on your website,
and especially if they are out of regular preliminary patterns
—which can be more substantial through the [fingerprinting](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Credential_Stuffing_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#device-fingerprinting)
technique.
Those times when you see multiple IP addresses in action
as something unusual
(perhaps due to proxies in credential stuffing),
you can also use geolocation
and find out if the countries or regions
to which those IPs belong
correspond to those places
from which your application is typically accessed.
You could send emails to those users
to guarantee that they were the ones
who tried to gain access.

It is important that
you establish countermeasures to potential attacks
and thus let attackers know that
they may waste time and effort with your web application.
You could start by considering even simple solutions
such as [Fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
for blocking IP addresses
when many failed requests are generated from a single one.
[CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA)
may be an additional countermeasure,
and [reCAPTCHA v3](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3),
which is easy to integrate into the applications,
is usually more recommended these days
to differentiate between bots and humans.

A slightly more advanced and recommended strategy
to prevent credential stuffing
is the [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication).
This security solution could indeed affect,
to some extent,
your 'users' journey' in your application
while they respond with every evidence
(factor)
required for information access.
For this reason,
you should be very careful,
and preferably choose to use this method
in cases of suspected attack
or in circumstances where the user requires sensitive data.

Finally,
and after considering the prior low-cost options
to hinder the attackers' efforts,
you can also call on commercial services
against credential stuffing
such as [Cloudflare Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/es-es/products/bot-management/)
and [F5 Bot Management](https://www.f5.com/solutions/application-security/bot-management).
Always keeping in mind that
"No silver bullet exists
so be wary of any company who tries to sell you one"
