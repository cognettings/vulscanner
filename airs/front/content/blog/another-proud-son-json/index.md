Today everything is connected,
and thus,
everything is communicated.
Security has become a major issue
in the complex world of web applications and their communications.

## JSON Web Token

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a URL safe way to represent a set of information
between two parties.
The information shared between the parties can be referred to as claims.
It is a safe way to transfer information
because it can be signed using a secret or using a public or private key.
The token is a base64 encoded string
which due to its short length is meant for space constrained environments.

There are two basic scenarios in which the use of a JWT is recommended.

- Once a user is authenticated in an application
  and wishes to make subsequent requests,
  each one of those request should include a JWT
  to make sure that the user has access to certain routes,
  services or resources.

- To exchange information in a secure manner
  making use of the signature.
  The signature is calculated based on the body and the payload of the JWT
  which allows a party to know if the message has been tampered with
  (Auth0, 2015).

The JWT is made up of three parts that are separated by a single dot.
Remember all the values are base64 encoded (header.payload.signature).

1. **Header:**

    1. **Algorithm:** This refers to the algorithm used to sign the token.
        Usually HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

    2. **Type:** Refers to the type of token. In this case "JWT".

2. **Payload:** Contains claims (names are only 3 characters long),
    which are statements about the user/entity
    and any additional metadata.
    Types of claims:

    - **Reserved:** Predefined but not mandatory.

    - **Public:** Defined by the user.
      Should be defined in a collision resistant namespace.

    - **Private:** Custom created to share information between parties.

3. **Signature:** This is made by taking the encoded header,
    payload and secret/key
    and using the algorithm specified in the header to sign it.

### How it works

As we can see in the image above,
we have three entities.
The user,
the authentication server
and the application server.
Here we have four steps.

1. **Initial authentication:**
    The user first signs in to the authentication server.
    If we are talking about a company this could be the active directory.

2. **JWT generation:**
    The JWT is created by the authentication server
    and sent to the user to be used in further request.

3. **User request:**
    The user then makes an API call.
    In a company this could be a query made in the company's billing system.
    The JWT is added to the original request
    and sent to the application server.

4. **JWT verification:**
    The application server,
    billing system in our example,
    makes sure the call is coming from an authenticated user
    by checking the JWT
    and then returns a response to the user.

### JWT Security

Remember the data in the JWT is encoded and signed but not encrypted.
The data is encoded to transform the data structure
and allow transportation following a standard definition.
The data is signed to verify authenticity
which lets me know if a message has been tampered with
but it does not prevent it.

Here is a great article on how to [Use JWT The Right
Way\!](https://stormpath.com/blog/jwt-the-right-way)

Other alternatives
like SAML (Security Assertion Mark-up Language)
imply larger XML documents.
JWTs are great when we have space constrained environments
and are looking to guarantee the authenticity of the data being transported.
