In our previous article, we merely scratched the surface of the problem
that quantifying risks poses, barely touching on concepts such as
calibrated estimation, confidence intervals and specifying the measuring
object. Now that (if?) we are convinced that:

- Cybersecurity risk can and should be measured in time-framed
  probabilities rather than "low", "medium" or "high".

- Estimates should be made not as unrealistic point estimates, but
  instead as confidence intervals which allow room for uncertainty.

- Even small data can tell us a lot if we use the right tools.
  Quantitative methods are applicable wherever less precise methods
  are.

- Experts can make good estimates with the right training.

Let us see how we can turn that into dollars and cents.

Suppose we want to measure the loss incurred by suffering a denial of
service attack (the *risk*). We can decompose the problem into the
number of systems affected, the number of hours these are out of
service, the revenue streams that rely on these systems, and so a
trained expert from your company estimates, with 90% confidence, that
the associated loss can fall anywhere between $2 and $7 million. This is
our calibrated estimate of the *impact* to the organization.

Now, instead of rating the "likelihood" on a scale from 1 to 5 as is
done in the risk "matrices", allow the experts from your [security
testers](../../) to make an estimate in terms of probabilities.
Something like "there is a 15% chance that the organization undergoes a
denial of service" is what we need to hear here. This particular
estimate could be averaged with the ones given by other experts, if need
be.

These are all the inputs needed to run a simulation from which we can
extract the expected loss associated to a particular risk, the
probability of such loss or more, or the overall company-wide loss
expected from IT assets, by running a so-called *Monte Carlo
simulation*. In a nutshell, this means that we’re going to simulate the
events in a year many times and average the results. A risk happens or
not depending on the likelihood given above and the associated costs are
taken at random from the above confidence interval.

For a single "simulated year", we just need to generate a random number
between 0 and 1. If it is below .15, we say that the event happened.
Simple. Now we need to figure out how much we lost. The random number
generated above was easy because all numbers between 0 and 1 are equally
likely. This is called a *uniform distribution*. However, in the case of
losses, not all numbers are equally likely. We need to generate them
according to a different *probability distribution* which responds to
two things: the confidence interval (`CI`) estimated by the expert, and
its values should always be positive. The most popular distribution for
modeling is the *normal* distribution, a.k.a. the Gaussian bell:

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

</div>

</div>

However it always allows room for negative values, no matter how much
you push the mean parameter towards the positive side, as you see above.
For this particular purpose the best fit is the *log-normal* family of
distributions, the distribution of the logarithm of a normally
distributed variable.

<div class="imgblock">

Plus, it has the advantage of being a little skewed towards the lower
values, instead of being perfectly symmetric around the mean, which
makes lower values more probable and hence is in better correspondence
with the reality.

</div>

Thus, when the event happens, we can draw a value from the (one and
only) lognormal distribution that has the 90% `CI` estimated by the
experts, and call that the loss for that risk in that simulated year. We
can do the same for other risks, add them all up and so get a global
loss due to cybersecurity in that simulated year, thus obtaining a table
similar to this one:

in a "simulated year"[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#r1)

</div>

</div>

Notice how, given that the probabilities for each risk are small, none
larger than 10%, most rows, most of the time, will display a loss of $0.
Now the way to make this into a useful simulation is to run it many
times and writing down the results, packed up into bins with which we
could make a histogram, or better yet, a curve.

<div class="imgblock">

From these results, we can build a [loss exceedance
curve](../quantifying-risk/), simply by counting the number of times the
simulated results are higher than a threshold, and plotting the results:

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

</div>

</div>

The risk tolerance curve can be obtained from estimation as well, this
time by appropriately interviewing an executive expert about the maximum
chance with which they would be able to tolerate certain loss
thresholds, plotting those risks on a graph, and fitting
([interpolating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation)) a curve
to these points:

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

The *residual risk curve* corresponds to the probabilities obtained by
the same method we used to generate the normal (*inherent*) risk, only
with different occurrence likelihoods estimated by a security expert. So
we would just run the Monte Carlo simulation again, only this time with
a 1% probability of a denial of service instead of the 15% we used
before. Thus we would expect to obtain a curve whose loss probabilities
are generally lower than the ones in the inherent risk curve:

<div class="imgblock">

</div>

From these results it is now easier to quantify, compare and finally
make a decision regarding which security control assets to invest in.
From the Monte Carlo simulations, we could just average the losses to
obtain the *expected loss*. Suppose that is $10 million. Assume that a
certain control, for example, setting up an Intrusion Detection System,
makes the probability of the denial of service lower to 8%, and the
probability of some of other events go down as well. If we run the
simulation again, we will obtain a different, most likely lower,
expected loss. Call it $8M, and suppose the `IDS` costs $0.5M. In that
case we might say that the *return on the control* is given by

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

</div>

Clearly, an investment that reduces the expected loss by four times its
cost is clearly worth it. Try to compare that cost to having 2
red-colored risks and 3 yellow ones.

---
To recap,
this loss exceedance curve is obtained
by running several simulations which,
in turn,
feed from two expert estimates:
the estimated cost of a security event,
reported as a confidence interval,
and the probability of an event occurring,
given the context in which
such a vulnerability would happen.
The first can be easily estimated internally,
but the second can only be determined
from a thorough security audit
and [penetration testing](../../solutions/penetration-testing/).
From the above numbers,
which are of course made up,
but not so out of this world,
you can make a more informed decision
regarding the investments your organization is willing to make
regarding both offensive and defensive security.
With the above tool,
you have the gist to make these simulations yourself.
