Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
we had already witnessed cyberattacks
that made us [suspect a cyberwar.](../cyberwar-ukraine/)
It was on February 24,
with Russian troops entering its neighboring country,
that cyberattacks from one side to the other
and system disruptions [began to be reported.](../timeline-new-cyberwar/)
In addition,
the Ukrainians' recruitment of volunteer hackers
and cybersecurity specialists
and the hacking groups supporting one side or the other
were public actions.
We started to see news of assaults
in European countries close to Ukraine and the United States
a few days later.
As a result,
the reports discussed in this blog post appeared:
warnings and advice for prevention and protection
against potential cyberattacks.

## CISA's Shields Up

In late February,
the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) warned of possible malicious cyber activity by Russians
against organizations of all sizes
in the U.S. and allied countries
in its [Shields Up campaign.](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up)
It emphasized their need to be prepared for attacks
and protect their critical assets
and requested that they report any such incidents to CISA.
Among the advised actions,
it began with those linked to reducing the likelihood of damage.

Among those recommendations were the following:
(a) Have multi-factor authentication for remote access,
especially privileged access,
to the organization's network.
(b) Ensure that the software components are up to date,
mainly concerning the CISA's [catalog of known exploited vulnerabilities,](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
with 570 entries at the time of writing this post.
(c) Check that ports and protocols
that are not essential to the organization
are disabled.
(d) Implement security controls
to defend against attacks targeting cloud services,
following [a guide CISA provided](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-013a)
early last year.
(We invite you [to read a post](../shared-responsibility-model/)
where we point out how confusion
with the cloud shared responsibility model
can mean trouble for your firm.)
And finally,
(e) use the free [CISA cyber hygiene service](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services)
for vulnerability identification.

In terms of intrusion detection,
CISA highlighted the need to have a cybersecurity staff
alert to any strange behavior
on the organization's network.
This is facilitated by enabling logging.
Furthermore,
CISA recommended the use of up-to-date antivirus or antimalware software.
And,
if there is contact with any Ukrainian sector,
it advised to pay more attention to the traffic from there.
Regarding the response to intrusion,
this agency suggested having a crisis response team
with well-defined roles and duties.
It must have permanent availability
and the means to provide emergency support.
Besides,
it should carry out incident simulation exercises
within the organization.

Likewise,
CISA provided advice on resilience to cyberattacks.
First of all,
the ability to restore critical data.
It is vital to ensure that backups are separated from network connections.
Another item is that,
if operational technology is used,
manual control tests should be performed
to ensure that critical functions are not affected
in an impact on the network.
Finally,
CISA gave [corporate leaders advice](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Focus_Areas_for_CEOs.pdf)
on their roles in their organizations' posture
and about [response processes](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Ransomware_Response_Checklist_508.pdf)
to [ransomware attacks.](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide)

## The White House's Fact Sheet

A week ago,
the Biden-Harris Administration
on the White House website
[sent a message](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/21/fact-sheet-act-now-to-protect-against-potential-cyberattacks/)
that added to previous warnings,
such as the aforementioned by CISA.
In this fact sheet,
they were clear that ongoing investigations suggest possible cyberattacks
from Russia on the U.S.
Especially due to the economic sanctions
that Putin's nation has received
since the invasion of Ukraine.
They talked about the current modernization of their government defenses.
They also referred to action plans to reinforce cybersecurity
in the water and electricity sectors.
Likewise,
they reported on a broad international alliance
to detect and disrupt [ransomware](../ransomware/)
threats.

As the U.S. Administration stated,
their work has been accelerated since the end of 2021.
They were sending several warnings to the country's firms
to be aware of possible threats
and to be able to defend themselves and respond to cyberattacks.
In the fact sheet,
they reminded us that
much of the critical infrastructure in the U.S.
is owned and operated by the private sector.
And they emphasized specific steps
to be followed by companies in terms of cybersecurity.

Similar to the CISA's report,
the U.S. Administration began by stressing
the value of multi-factor authentication.
In general terms,
they recommended deploying tools for threat identification and mitigation.
They suggested keeping systems patched and protected
against known vulnerabilities.
Furthermore,
they advised changing passwords,
something we should all be doing [frequently.](../pass-cracking/)
Additionally,
they also recommended crucial offline backups
and crisis simulation exercises.

Further on,
they mentioned something quite relevant,
different from what we saw in the previous report:
encrypting data so that it cannot be used by criminals if stolen.
Another of their suggested steps was to educate employees
about attacker tactics in email and websites.
(See [this post](../social-engineering/)
to get an idea.)
This,
in addition to urging them to report difficulties
and unusual behavior on their systems.
(Look at [this post](../human-security-sensor/).)
At the end of these first steps,
the White House recommended that
companies proactively engage in interaction with CISA and FBI offices
and the resources they offer.

Lastly,
in the interest of greater cybersecurity in the long term,
the Administration offered some suggestions
to technology and software firms.
On the one hand,
they invited companies to develop software in highly secure systems.
On the other hand,
as recommended by Fluid Attacks,
they suggested the integration of security
from the beginning of product development.
(See the [DevSecOps methodology](../devsecops-concept/).)
Related to this,
they recommended employing scanning tools
for the early identification of known vulnerabilities.
(Fluid Attacks' [ethical hackers](../../solutions/ethical-hacking/)
can complement such tools
to report more complex vulnerabilities
and reduce false positives and negatives.)
The remediation process can be faster and less costly
when feedback to developers occurs
in phases prior to software deployment.
Additionally,
they underscored the need for developers
to always know and record the origin of the components they use.
Many of which are open-source code.

At Fluid Attacks,
we recognize the value of these general recommendations,
many of which we have shared on different occasions.
From our end,
we urge you to always resort to the preventive act
and not wait to be the victim of a successful cyberattack.
Looking for vulnerabilities
with services such as our [Continuous Hacking](../../services/continuous-hacking/)
and remediating them asap
can greatly protect the privacy and assets of your company
and your clients or users.
