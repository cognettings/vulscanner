Daniel Yepes is a Computer Engineer who has been working at Fluid Attacks
as Security Analyst for over two years. A few days ago,
he was certified as a Red Team Expert from
[Pentester Academy](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/).
This is a site founded in **2011**
by Vivek Ramachandran that "[furthers the careers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pentesteracademy)
of \[cybersecurity\] professionals worldwide with in-depth training,
attack-defense products and informative content that address the
ever-evolving landscape of online threats."

Daniel completed the [Advanced Red Team
Lab](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/redteamlab), the second in
difficulty out of three labs. These labs are offered at Pentester
Academy at different prices (**$299-699**) depending on the access
period’s length. Well, he didn’t actually perform the lab, but the
Certification Exam associated with that lab; we’d better let him tell us
about his experience.

1. I decided to take the Red Team Expert exam without taking the Red
    Team Professional one (the first on the list). You don’t have to do
    them in order. I wanted to be adventurous and beat my brains out,
    and I did. I had already taken this exam in October last year, but I
    failed. At that time, I paid for three months' access to the lab
    (which I didn’t do because of personal matters) before the test;
    this last time, I only paid for the test. **48** hours are allowed
    to take the exam and another **48** hours to prepare the report. I
    ended up using all the time for the former, and almost **24** hours
    for the latter.

<!-- end list -->

1. So, I just took the exam that comes with the lab. When you do the
    lab, you have to perform the stated objectives. There are around
    **60** flags you have to find there; these constitute proof that you
    reached each target. The lab is necessary for one not to feel
    overburdened in the exam and end up taking it several times. What I
    did was ask questions and do research. I asked people who had
    already accomplished it to give me some tips. However, it’s much
    better to do the lab and know what you’ll be dealing with, unless
    you already have a lot of experience.

Before we continue with Daniel, let’s summarize something shared about
the Advanced Red Team Lab on the [Pentester Academy
website](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/redteamlab). In short, this
lab is focused on threats and attacks to network infrastructure managed
with Windows Active Directory. The exercises constitute simulation of
real attack-defense events. The user is asked to achieve an enterprise
admin of multiple forests position just starting with a non-admin user
account, exploiting software vulnerabilities and overlooked domain
features. The user faces some challenges in this lab, among which are
the following: "active directory enumeration, local and forest privilege
escalation, network pivoting, application whitelisting bypass, active
user simulation, Kerberos delegation issues, `SQL` Servers, \[and\]
forest trusts."

**Why did you decide to get this "Certified Red Team Expert" (CRTE)
certificate?**

1. I decided to get this certificate because I found the subject very
    interesting to reinforce/learn new techniques for different
    projects. In some of them there were environments with Active
    Directory. This is a centralized system to manage objects, such as
    users, machines, permissions, etc. In that ecosystem, you can find
    things like antivirus, `EDRs`, monitoring systems, databases, file
    servers, among others. The intention in such projects is to reach a
    target without being detected. In the process are presented some
    valuable techniques/tools to avoid security controls, to perform a
    lateral movement, privilege escalation, and persistence by abusing
    the misconfiguration of some services. It also helps to reinforce
    the idea that obtaining Domain Admin is not the primary objective
    but part of the way to achieve a final goal.

<!-- end list -->

1. I had already obtained the
    [`OSCP`](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) (Offensive
    Security Certified Professional) certificate. The most notable
    difference between the `OSCP` and the `CRTE` certifications is the
    focus. The `OSCP` is very much based on the exploitation of services
    from public vulnerabilities. The `CRTE`, including the `CRTP`
    (Certified Red Team Professional), is more focused on understanding
    in depth some components of an active directory and identifying and
    abusing the misconfigurations that are present there.

**What is the knowledge you believe is required to obtain this
certificate?**

1. The knowledge I think someone should have before doing the lab is
    the following: some basics on how to approach this type of
    environment, knowing how to enumerate it with the different tools
    available, and a notion of some of the components and services that
    can be found. Furthermore, and as one of the most necessary
    knowledge is to have at least the basic ability to program in
    PowerShell.

**What kind of tasks do you have to complete in this Red Team Lab
exam?**

1. Well, I don’t intend to talk about specific tasks, because that
    would literally be telling people what to study and what to expect.
    The most basic or essential tasks would be the following:

<!-- end list -->

1. **Enumerate.** This is to do recon; that is, recognizing which
    users/machines/services are present.

2. **Privilege escalation.** This is moving from having a user without
    administrative privileges to having a user who does have them. It
    can also be to obtain those privileges for the same user.

3. **Lateral movement.** This refers to the techniques used to move
    progressively on a network. In other words, it is looking for how to
    move from one machine to another or others to obtain more
    information to reach the goal.

**Which were the most difficult challenges? Any time did you feel at
your wits' end?**

1. The hardest part was getting almost halfway through the exam and not
    knowing what the hell else to do. One important thing to achieve
    here is `RCE` (Remote Command Execution). In vague terms, `RCE` is
    as if from your machine, you could execute system commands on
    another machine to which you have access. On the other hand, you
    have to make an excellent report, with precise argumentation. But,
    in the end, it’s an experience for the person taking the exam, and
    what is tough for me can be easy for someone else.

**What would you recommend to those who want to get this
certification?**

1. You should start by learning how to deal with active directory and
    Windows environments. You must learn how to do recon and evade
    antivirus, either for running a binary or a script on PowerShell.
    Also, you should learn about abusing services to achieve lateral
    movement or escalation of privileges. You must immerse yourself in
    this world, not forgetting that Google is your best friend.

<!-- end list -->

1. So, do a lot of research, reading, and testing. Besides, if you can,
    go to the lab, or make a home lab, there are very good guidelines.
    That’s something perfect to understand concepts, abuse services, and
    try to mitigate attacks. It’s very time-consuming, but you can do it
    bit by bit. I think it is great to have that conception in mind, how
    to attack and defend. That way, you gain more mastery of the
    subject, and you can have a more general view of what can be
    presented, either in the exam or in a particular project.

**Do you have any certification in mind as the next one to get?**

1.  [OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/ctp-osce/) or
    [PACES](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/gcb).

We are grateful to Daniel for sharing this information with us, and
again we congratulate him on his new achievement.
It is an honor to have accomplished experts like him on our [red team](../../solutions/red-teaming/).
We hope to bring you more interviews with them in the future,
as well as information related to certifications in [pentesting](../../solutions/penetration-testing/).
By the way, we
constantly publish content on attacks. So, if you are interested in
learning how to perform some techniques, don’t hesitate to subscribe to
our blog.
