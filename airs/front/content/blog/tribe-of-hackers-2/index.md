In July this year,
[I wrote a post](../tribe-of-hackers-1/)
based on the book [*Tribe of Hackers Red Team*](https://www.amazon.com/Tribe-Hackers-Red-Team-Cybersecurity/dp/1119643325)
by Marcus J. Carey and Jennifer Jin (2019).
On that occasion,
I presented a short description of the book,
which is primarily aimed at all those interested in red teams
(Fluid Attacks,
for example,
is a [red team](../../solutions/red-teaming/)).
Additionally,
I referred to Marcus's answers to the questions
that he and Jin then addressed
to the more than 40 experts
that appear in their book.
For this post,
I will focus on what was shared
by one of those red team experts.
I hope it will be of your interest
—bear in mind the meaningful value
other people's experiences will always have for our learning.

In this case, we have the
[American-Canadian](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Benjamin_Donnelly_\(polymath\))
engineer Benjamin Donnelly, who "has worked as part of teams hacking
such things as prisons, power plants, multinationals, and even entire
states." He has participated in research projects like the DARPA-funded
Active Defense Harbinger Distribution
([ADHD](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/free-tools/adhd/)) and was
the [Ball and Chain
cryptosystem](https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon4/t108-ball-and-chain-a-new-paradigm-in-stored-password-security-benjamin-donnelly-and-tim-tomes)'s
creator.

Ben got closer to the world of red teams when, being in high school, he
participated in a competition of the US cyber education program
[CyberPatriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberPatriot). Although his
training there was more geared towards the [blue
team](../purple-team/)'s work, he managed to move into the "red arts"
and began participating in
[NetWars](https://www.sans.org/cyber-ranges/netwars-tournaments/core/)
tournaments. There, competing against professionals, Ben began to gain
recognition for his skills and even succeeded in getting a job with a
[SANS](https://www.sans.org/) instructor. After that, and certainly
through hard work, he obtained the official job title of penetration
tester/security researcher.

## For those hoping to be eager beavers on red teams

Benjamin gives some recommendations to get a job in a red team. What he
initially suggests is to recognize subtle differences between companies
that perform this kind of work. Therefore he separates them into two
groups, and for each case, he offers some advice.

Ben refers to the first group as "the computer network operator-type
team," which focuses on exploiting networks or systems through diverse
frameworks and hacking tools. The ways in which the attackers can gain
and leverage access are then reported to the client. Accordingly,
Benjamin comments: "If you want to join one of these teams, you need to
be focusing on training on breach simulation because that’s what their
world is all about."
Indeed,
at Fluid Attacks
[breach and attack simulation](../what-is-breach-attack-simulation/)
is part of our job.
Moreover, Ben says that you don’t usually need lots
of certificates for a job like this, and you don’t even have to possess
college degrees if you have enough skills and make yourself known. Such
is the case for working with us as an [ethical hacker or
pentester](../../careers/openings/), for example.

Ben refers to the second group as "the security engineering-type team."
According to him, they are focused on creating and auditing complex
solutions to improve "the technical sophistication and security of a
given software or hardware system." This team prioritizes system
analysis from various perspectives and responds with the necessary
controls to possible attack vectors that hackers might use on particular
systems. And although I see this kind of work as more related to blue
teams, I could also associate it with the position of [IT security
architects](../../careers/openings/) at Fluid Attacks. By the way, a
university degree is not required in our company to apply for this job
either. But as Ben says, for both groups, "you'll want some combination
of computer science and information technology knowledge."

According to Ben, learning the necessary basic skills (e.g.,
manipulation of infrastructure) working in computer network defense
positions will facilitate your transition to a job within a red team.
"You’ll learn about what it is that attackers do as you learn to
anticipate them." On the other hand, apart from the technical aspect,
this young expert recommends working on some attitudes. He suggests
keeping active the dispositions to ask questions, recognize without
problems the ignorance on one or another subject, and correct oneself.

## For those already sweating blood on red teams

From Ben’s perspective, the red team’s work is curiously more efficient
when done individually. He refers to interpersonal communication as a
big problem because this profession involves enormous amounts of
information. Besides, the operations that are carried out are often very
complex and highly specific. From his experience, Ben says: "We have to
work out what’s happening inside \[the system\] by tracking huge numbers
of variables indicated by external responses (such as error messages).
Communicating exactly what is happening (and when) to each other can be
a huge challenge."

However, Ben shows a strong interest in collaboration when working with
blue teams and prefers the [gray-box testing
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_box_testing) instead of the
black-box. (Nevertheless, the approach to be used regularly depends on
what the organization you are working for chooses.) Ideally, for him,
the analysts would be "testing discrete sections of the
application/network to understand the threats posed to exactly that
portion of the system independent of any other protective layers."

For Ben, red teams' members should not orient their work towards the
*I’m living a hacker’s life* posture, desiring only to impress other
people. This profession should have among its central objectives to help
security teams optimize their systems' or software’s security. That’s
why he says: "If questioned, I consider it my job to tell the product
team literally everything I know. If they can hold all that knowledge,
then I as a red cell professional need to move on and discover more." By
the way, and as a fundamental aspect to take into account in the reports
you have to make, Ben suggests the following: "Be detailed, correct, and
honest."

## For firms that in security aspire to be on the ball

When Ben is asked about the least effective security control currently
in use, he seems to refer without hesitation to firewall technology.
"All these expensive 'security' devices that seem to keep selling like
hotcakes are effectively capable of stopping 0 percent of technically
sophisticated adversaries." The biggest problem is that many people who
choose to access such technology are unaware of its actual capabilities.

One of Ben’s most important recommendations in preventing attacks on
systems or networks is "one hundred percent client (host) isolation."
According to him, few companies currently in their networks require
systems to communicate directly with each other. Cloud services have
become especially relevant recently, and business applications do not
have to live
[on-premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software). The
implementation of isolation helps enormously prevent attacks in which
hackers could "gain access to and exploit your network resources." Ben
concludes this part by saying: "Without device-to-device access, how am
I supposed to find and exploit unpatched servers or workstations on your
network? How am I supposed to pivot laterally? How am I supposed to
relay credentials or access a rogue
[SMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block) shared
directory?"

## That’s all, folks!

All these were fairly simple yet worthwhile tips and ideas drawn from
what Benjamin Donnelly shared on *Tribe of Hackers Red Team*. I hope you
enjoyed them. If you'd like to know more about our red team at Fluid Attacks,
