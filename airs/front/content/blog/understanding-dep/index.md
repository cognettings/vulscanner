In past blog entries, we’ve written a good amount of articles dealing
with Windows exploit development, [most of them](../tags/vulnserver/)
attacking Vulnserver, a vulnerable-by-design (`VbD`) server that,
as can be easily guessed, is designed for such a noble endeavor.
We also wrote a couple of articles
creating an exploit for [QuickZIP](../quickzip-exploit/) and [MiTec Net
Scanner](../netscan-exploit/). All of those exploits relied on the
ability to execute instructions written on the stack of the process.

However, modern CPUs have a mechanism that allow the OS to prevent that.

In this article, we will introduce that protection and in forthcoming
articles we will check a way to bypass it, called `ROP` (Return-Oriented
Programming).

## No-Execute bit

The protection on the CPUs is known as the NX (No-Execute) bit. The OS
will use such capability to mark some memory areas (remarkably, the
stack) as non-executable and thus, prevent common buffer overflow
exploits like the ones we’ve used so far. Let’s clarify that.

In `x86` architecture, when a function is called, a function frame is
created on the stack. This is a common function stack frame distribution
on memory:

**Common function stack frame.**

``` text
.____________._____________._____________._____________._________________.
   vuln_var     Saved EBP     Saved EIP     Func args     Rest of stack
```

On a simple buffer overflow, when we write past the `vuln_var` size, we
can overwrite anything that’s below the stack, including the `Saved EBP`
and `Saved EIP`. When the vulnerable function returns, it will get the
`Saved EIP` value back from the stack and use it as the next instruction
pointer. That’s why we usually overwrite the `Saved EIP` with a pointer
to a `JMP ESP` instruction that allows us to redirect execution back to
the stack on where we put the shellcode.

**Example overflowed vuln\_var.**

``` text
 AAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA <pointer to JMP ESP>    Shellcode
.____________._____________.____________________._______________.
   vuln_var     Saved EBP         Saved EIP       Rest of stack
```

For example, let’s take a look a this exploit:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
## Simple DEP check

import socket
import struct

HOST = '192.168.0.20'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'TRUN .' +
    b'A' * 2006 +
    # 625011AF   .  FFE4                  JMP ESP
    struct.pack('<L', 0x625011AF) +
    b'\x31\xc0' +       # xor eax,eax
    b'\x04\x08' +       # add al,0x8
    b'\x90' +           # nop
    b'C' * 990
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

This is a simple exploit that will take advantage of a buffer overflow
vulnerability of the Vulnserver `TRUN` command.
[Here](../vulnserver-trun/) you can see the full writeup of how to find
that vulnerability using fuzzing and [here](../reversing-vulnserver/)
using reverse engineering.

This version of the exploit will overflow the vulnerable variable this
way:

**Example overflowed vuln\_var.**

``` text
 AAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA \xaf\x11\x50\x62  \x31\xc0\x04\x08\x90 CCCCCCCCCCC
.____________._____________._________________.____________________.___________.
   vuln_var     Saved EBP       Saved EIP          Shellcode       Fill buffer
```

Where:

1. 2,006 `A`s are added to trigger the overflow.

2. `0x625011AF` is a pointer to a `JMP ESP` instruction and will be
    placed on `Saved EIP`.

3. When the vulnerable function returns, it will execute the
    instruction pointed by `Saved EIP` which holds the `JMP ESP`
    instruction.

4. With that, the execution flow is now redirected to the stack
    where the shellcode was placed.

5. The shellcode, in this case will execute three arbitrary
    instructions:

    1. `xor eax eax` → Zero-outs `EAX` register

    2. `add al,0x8` → Makes `EAX` = `0x00000008`

    3. `nop` → Does nothing

Let’s see it in action:

</div>

As you can see, we were able to execute the instructions on our
shellcode that we placed on the stack, as expected.

## Enabling DEP

On modern Windows versions, the NX bit of the CPU can be leveraged by
using a feature called Data Execution Prevention or `DEP`. An
application can be compiled with the `/NXCOMPAT` flag to enable `DEP`
for that application. Also, you can use `editbin.exe /NXCOMPAT` over an
`.exe` file to enable it on an already compiled file.

In a debugger, we can check if an executable has that flag enabled:

<div class="imgblock">

![Modules with NXCOMPAT](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331133/blog/understanding-dep/nxenabled_ggy9vw.webp)

</div>

You can also enable `DEP` system-wide, which will force `DEP` to all
applications, including those compiled without `/NXCOMPAT`. To do that,
you can use the following instructions:

- Press the `Windows` key and search for `View advanced system
  settings`.

- In the resulting window, click on tab `Advanced`:

<div class="imgblock">

![Enabling DEP](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331133/blog/understanding-dep/enable-dep1_jkzhsm.webp)

</div>

- Then in `Performance` click on `Settings`.

- Move to the tab `Data Execution Prevention`:

<div class="imgblock">

![Enabling DEP](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331134/blog/understanding-dep/enable-dep2_eqdu9f.webp)

</div>

- The default setting is `Turn on DEP for essential Windows
  programs…​`, but to turn it on for every application, you must
  select `Turn on DEP for all programs…​`.

- Apply and restart the PC.

**WARNING:** When you change this value and you have `Bitlocker`
enabled, you will be asked to enter the `Bitlocker` recovery key after
the reboot. **If you don’t have that information, please don’t change
the `DEP` value or your system will become unusable.**

With that in place, we can check our exploit again to see if `DEP`
really prevents the execution of the instructions of our shellcode.

**NOTE:** We will talk about Hardware-based `DEP`, which uses the NX bit
of the CPU to mark memory regions as non-executable. Software-based
`DEP` will only prevent SEH-based overflows, and that’s not in the scope of
this article. You can get more information on SEH-based exploits
[here](../vulnserver-gmon/).

## Executing shellcode with DEP enabled

Now, after enabling `DEP` system-wide, let’s execute our exploit again:

<div class="imgblock">

![DEP enabled](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331134/blog/understanding-dep/exec-stack2_irsdv6.gif)

</div>

Several things have happened:

1. The overflow is performed.

2. The `Saved EIP` value was overwritten successfully with the pointer
    to `JMP ESP`.

3. The `JMP ESP` instruction is performed and execution flow is
    redirected to the stack where our shellcode is placed.

4. However, when it tries to execute the first instruction on the
    shellcode (`xor eax,eax`), an `Access violation` exception is
    triggered, which means that it was trying to execute code on a
    memory region marked as non-executable. `DEP` worked.

## Bypassing DEP

Now, we cannot execute instructions placed on the stack, but we control
the execution flow of the application. However, the stack is a place
where the application (and therefore, the exploit) can read and write
data and by controlling both (the execution flow and the stack), we can
do wonders.

In the previous example, we couldn’t execute the instructions on the
shellcode, but we **were able** to execute a single instruction: `JMP
ESP`. We did that by placing the **pointer** to the instruction in the
right place.

We can use that to run arbitrary code, without executing a single
instruction on the stack. Let’s welcome [Return-Oriented
Programming](../bypassing-dep/).

## Conclusions

This article shows a mechanism created to prevent the exploitation of
buffer overflow vulnerabilities. `DEP` surely renders common
exploits unsuccessful.
However, in the [next article](../bypassing-dep/) we will see
how to bypass `DEP` using Return-Oriented Programming and later we can
create a fully working exploit that triggers a reverse TCP shell on a
DEP-enabled application.
