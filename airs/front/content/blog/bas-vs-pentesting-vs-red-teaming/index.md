Offensive security testing comes in different approaches.
The prominent names are breach and attack simulation,
penetration testing and red teaming.
Their common goal is to determine the strengths
and weaknesses of security defenses in systems
by assessments based on attacks.
But they differ in their execution.
At least as they are conceived most commonly.
Mainly,
there are differences in whether they involve manual tests,
assess the attack surface continuously,
attack with the organizations' security teams' awareness of the contract,
include security at more than the IT system level,
and have only specific crown jewels in their scope.
At Fluid Attacks we see the shortcomings
in the way most products and providers conduct some of these approaches
and raise our own way,
based on what we perceive to be the present and future of cybersecurity.

In this blog post,
we talk about the differences between breach and attack simulation,
penetration testing and red teaming,
and explain how we break out of the mold in these last two methods.
Along the way,
we link to other posts where we handle these approaches separately in detail.

## The goal they have in common

Organizations worldwide are beginning to understand
that they need to secure their digital assets preventively
against the looming threat of cybercrime.
Under the present circumstances,
they recognize it is not enough
to scan or review their systems for known weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
They need also to prove
that such systems do not let actual attacks be successful.
A safe way to test and verify this is found
in offensive security testing approaches.

We talk about three such approaches here:
breach and attack simulation (BAS),
penetration testing and red teaming.
Development teams,
and organizations in general,
leverage them to test their systems' detection,
resistance and response against attacks
that today's threat actors may conduct.
As we will repeat below,
in the case of red teaming,
security testing may include physical facilities and employees as its targets.

## Breach and attack simulation vs. penetration testing

[Breach and attack simulation](../what-is-breach-attack-simulation/)
solutions have been introduced to the market of security testing
more recently than penetration testing solutions.
In some instances,
they are pitted against each other
with the purpose of answering which one is best.
Still,
because they share the goal we mentioned above,
there's confusion around the differences between the two.

Most BAS descriptions agree
that this approach tests the effectiveness of the security controls
of organizations' systems through attack simulations.
Especially,
it evaluates whether controls are configured correctly
and can aptly detect, resist and respond to the latest threats and techniques.
(To learn which controls are paid the most attention,
read our [blog post about BAS](../what-is-breach-attack-simulation/).)

[Penetration testing](../what-is-manual-penetration-testing/)
is a quite more familiar term for some.
We describe it as the simulation of attacks
that a genuine threat actor may conduct against systems.
It usually involves looking for vulnerabilities
and generating exploits to bypass the system defenses.
The targets are often the same controls that are tested with BAS solutions.

To differentiate between the two,
some sources say BAS answers the question
of whether operational security controls work properly,
whereas pen testing assesses whether attackers can breach the system.
But these do not seem like two different things.
To explain what such sources may be referring to,
it's important to understand
that not all BAS solutions resemble the standard penetration testing.

Some BAS solutions are tools
that limit their tests to internal network security.
They install agents on virtual machines,
personal computers and servers,
where they only check for issues
that match a database of known vulnerabilities.
They do not test organizations' perimeter defenses.
Neither do more advanced BAS tools
that work generating malicious traffic inside the internal network,
simulating the logical steps of known techniques.
These tools cannot answer whether external attackers can get in.

Other BAS solutions can launch Internet-based attacks
that test perimeter defenses.
They reproduce attacks present in knowledge bases like
the MITRE ATT&CK®
(adversarial tactics, techniques and common knowledge) framework
to check whether the defenses can be bypassed.
Their results point to controls in governance frameworks
(e.g., those in NIST 800-53) mapped to such knowledge bases.
These,
like other kinds of BAS tools,
return likely attack paths and actionable mitigation insights.

Now let us compare this last kind to pentesting as they are commonly conceived:

Their differences are in the execution.
One such difference is **_most_ BAS solutions rely solely on tools,
whereas penetration testing is always done manually**.
Indeed,
pen testing is performed by humans,
who can creatively launch exploits according to the organizations' context
and imitate the likely behavior of criminals.
(So,
throughout this writing
we are always referring to "manual penetration testing.")
Despite the seemingly legit claims by some vendors
that their tools leverage this methodology,
we have argued in [a previous blog post](../what-is-manual-penetration-testing/)
that there is no such thing as automated penetration testing.

Now,
while automation offers reports faster than humans
and its implementation can decrease manual effort,
tool accuracy is a concern.
Relying only on automated scans
would yield a great number of false positives.
Moreover
because some time must be allowed
between the announcement and understanding of an attack technique
and its later addition to the tools' repertoire,
there tend to be significant rates of false negatives.

Manual work helps accuracy and detecting the issues
that represent the most exposure to attacks.
(To learn more, read our [2022 report](https://try.fluidattacks.tech/state-of-attacks-2022/).)
Ethical hackers,
or pen testers,
use the same tools and techniques a malicious threat actor would.
Contrary to tools,
they can get started as soon as cybersecurity researchers
and response teams,
among other entities (e.g., the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team),
announce the threats.
This prevents causing a time window
during which the current threats may hit the systems.

Another difference is
that **BAS solutions always test systems continuously,
whereas _most_ pentesting offerings assess them just regularly.**
Please notice we say "most":
A model that addresses the need of continuous penetration tests does exist
and is called [penetration testing as a service](../../product/ptaas/)
(PTaaS).
In regards to cybersecurity spend,
it is the general opinion
that having humans perform security testing is more costly
than relying on automation.
But given what was explained above,
it may actually be more costly in the long run
to stick to automation only and avoid continuous manual assessments.

At Fluid Attacks,
we acknowledge the limitations
in the way penetration testing solutions are conducted in the industry.
Our understanding is that,
as threats evolve constantly and rapidly,
security testing should support prevention effectively.
It can do so by providing accurate and updated statuses
of the security of systems.
For this reason,
we offer a [Penetration Testing solution](../../solutions/penetration-testing/)
along with automated security testing in a single service offering,
[Continuous Hacking](../../services/continuous-hacking/).
We combine automation and manual work to test systems continuously.
Our vulnerability scanner runs permanently,
and at the same time we assign ten ethical hackers on average to probe systems.
This methodology allows organizations to make sure
that every change in their systems can withstand the relentless efforts
of attackers to get in.

Now that we have settled the differences between BAS and pentesting,
as they are offered by most other vendors,
let's move on
to see the differences between penetration testing and red teaming.

## Penetration testing vs. red teaming

[Red teaming](../what-is-red-team-in-cyber-security/)
is another familiar term
that refers to the simulation of real-world attacks.
In this approach,
security specialists attack under the modality
of what are known as "[red team exercises](../red-team-exercise/)."
These are essentially operations
where they, the red team, advance offensively toward specific objectives.
The target organization must detect the attacks and respond.
In such exercises,
different teams may be created:
blue team, white team and [purple team](../purple-team/).

Basically,
the blue team is a group of defensive security specialists
(e.g., incident response consultants)
in the target organization
that manages the security controls
to address the intrusions of (in this context) the red team.
The white team is the group
that calls and approves the initiation and interruption of attacks.
And the purple team is responsible
for analyzing the interactions between the red and blue teams
and suggesting fixes, among other things.

The above suggests a couple of differences
to other offensive security approaches in terms of execution.
For instance: **In red teaming, none,
or some,
of the defenders know the attackers are contracted by the target organization,
whereas in penetration testing all the defenders are fully aware of it**.

We have included this in [a previous blog post](../attacking-without-announcing/)
as one of our suggested management policies
for conducting offensive security tests.
In short,
red teams should act just like malicious threat actors,
who do not notify when,
how and where they will attack,
what techniques they use,
what information they have accessed, etc.

Further,
as could be suspected from our definition of red team exercises,
**in red teaming,
the attackers _often_ have only specific crown jewels in their scope,
whereas in penetration testing the objective _often_ is
to find all the vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a system**.

Another difference,
which is one we mentioned earlier,
is that **red teaming may target an organization's employees
and physical facilities,
whereas pentesting solutions _often_ attack only IT systems**.
This means
that a red team would engage in activities such as [social engineering](../social-engineering/)
(e.g.,
attempting to influence employees to take security risks)
and trying to penetrate the company's facilities (e.g., to install devices).

At Fluid Attacks,
we offer our [Red Teaming solution](../../solutions/red-teaming/)
in which we agree with our clients on which targets to attack.
We do this,
again,
combining automated tools
and human ingenuity to evaluate targets continuously.

## Breach and attack simulation vs. red teaming

It could be easily guessed
that the differences between breach and attack simulation
and red teaming
mirror those between the former and penetration testing.
That is,
BAS solutions _normally_ rely on automation and test continuously,
whereas red teaming solutions rely on ethical hackers
and _normally_ test only regularly.

There is yet another issue to address.
Some vendors claim
that their BAS tools have red team and blue team features.
That is,
they emulate today's adversarial threat actors
and provide insight on mitigation.
And thus,
they help purple teaming tasks.
But all this seems like an effort to _liken_ tool actions
to what happens in a red teaming exercise.
In the end,
as long as the organization is run by humans,
who [panic](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3646616/the-emotional-stages-of-a-data-breach-how-to-deal-with-panic-anger-and-guilt.html)
at the moment of discovering a breach,
are [influenced by social factors](../social-engineering/),
make mistakes, etc.
these tools could not accurately test blue team operations.
We mentioned above how tools are limited also in their red team operations.
In short,
continuous manual intervention is always necessary.
Combining it with automated scans helps getting an accurate idea,
and fast,
about the security status of organizations.
