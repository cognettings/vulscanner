Our [previous blog post](../certificates-comparison-i/) reviewed each
beginner and intermediate certificate that our [Red
Team](../../solutions/red-teaming/) has achieved over the years. The
goal, of course, was to provide basic information, advice and
recommendations to those who are considering obtaining any of these
certificates but do not know precisely which one. Following that format
we will continue **(a)** describing the difficulty level of the
certificates, **(b)** explaining to whom they are directed, and **(c)**
illustrating what kind of knowledge, both practical and theoretical,
must be acquired to be certified.

On this occasion, we have grouped the most difficult certificates
designed for skillful pentesters. In this regard, it is expected that
people seeking to obtain them have experience in this field. Even if it
is not necessary, it is also likely that they have obtained the
certificates described in our blog post [What’s the Best Certification?
I](../certificates-comparison-i/).

## [**Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE)**](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/)

Granted by Offensive Security.\
It is an **intermediate** level certification. It is one of the three
certifications required to obtain the OSCE. It verifies the skills that
a candidate has to "[perform a deep analysis on decompiled web app
source code](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/)." This exam
requires experience as a pentester to understand better "[white box web
app pentesting](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/)." For
some, it is an examination "[focusing on abusing password reset
functionality and showing how certain implementations can be
insecure](https://medium.com/greenwolf-security/an-awae-oswe-review-2020-update-6d6ec7a80c1f)."
Like other intermediate certificates we have reviewed, this exam lasts
48 hours. You have an additional 24 hours to prepare and upload the
required documentation. Like the other two certificates needed to obtain
the OSCE, this certificate [does not
expire](https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/awae-oswe-faq/).

## [**Offensive Security Exploit Developer (OSED)**](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp301-osed/)

Granted by Offensive Security.\
In a past blog, [we interviewed Óscar Uribe](../osed-certification/),
one of our security analysts, about his experience obtaining this
certificate.

It is an **intermediate** level exam. OSED is usually done after the
[Offensive Security Certified Professional
(OSCP)](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/). It is considered
the end of Offensive Security’s triad of certifications before facing
the [Offensive Security Certified Expert
(OSCE)](https://www.offensive-security.com/ctp-osce/). It is necessary
to accomplish a 48-hour exam to obtain the OSED —like most
intermediate-level exams. Additionally, you have 24 hours available to
make and submit the report that accompanies the practical test. This
exam is focused on testing **reverse engineering** techniques, dedicated
to **create custom exploits** and **bypass security** mitigations.
Although not part of the course requirements, it is often recommended to
have experience reading and understanding C code at a basic level. In
addition, it is suggested to have the "[ability to read and understand
32-bit Assembly code at a basic
level](https://spaceraccoon.dev/rop-and-roll-exp-301-offensive-security-exploit-development-osed-review-and)."

## [**eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Tester (eWPTv1)**](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ewpt-certification/)

Granted by eLearnSecurity.\
In a past blog, [we interviewed Andres
Roldan](../ewptv1-certification/), our Offensive Team Leader, about his
experience obtaining this certificate.

It is an **advanced** certificate. If the [Certified Red Team Expert
(CRTE)](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/redteamlab) had taken
pentesting skills to the next level, the eWPTv1 demands complete mastery
of pentester skills. It is considered as one of "[the most advanced and
hands-on training path\[s\] on web application penetration testing in
the
market.](https://thomfre.dev/elearnsecurity-web-application-pentester)"
To obtain it, candidates must have had experience working in **web
application security**. A crucial examination point is a detailed report
required after completing the practical section. In this sense, this
certification demands excellent skills to **attack the vulnerabilities
of a system** and also verifies the candidate’s full-understanding of
the steps followed during the attack.

## [**eLearnSecurity Mobile Application Penetration Tester (eMAPT)**](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/emapt-certification/)

Granted by eLearnSecurity.\
It’s an **advanced** level certificate. As its name suggests, it is
designed for experts who want to test "[advanced mobile application
security knowledge through a scenario-based
exam](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/emapt-certification/)." This
makes it a unique certificate among all we have reviewed. Until now, no
certificate has been specific to mobile application security aspects. It
is an entirely hands-on exam and focuses on the analysis of Android
applications architecture. The candidate will be challenged with two
Android applications that will have "[to analyze and
pentest](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/emapt-certification/)." To
do so, the candidate must "[write an Android application that exploits
vulnerabilities](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/courses-and-certifications-reviews/ine-courses-and-elearnsecurity-certifications-reviews),"
which is usually one of the most challenging parts of the exam.
Additionally, it has a section dedicated to making a professional report
on what has been done in the practical section. Like other
eLearnSecurity exams, it is up to the candidate to take the a course
([INE
training](https://my.ine.com/path/eec5479e-a8d1-4803-817f-c016bb528639)
or take the exam confident in their experience in the field.

## [**eLearnSecurity Web application Penetration Tester eXtreme (eWPTXv2)**](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ewptxv2-certification/)

Granted by eLearnSecurity.\
It is a **very advanced** certificate. It’s more complex than the
eWPTv1. In fact, eLearnSecurity touts it as "[our most advanced web
application pentesting
certification](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ewptxv2-certification/)."
The report that candidates must submit should be much more complete than
the one they presented in the eWPTv1. In a sense, it has to be more
"professional" than the report in eWPTv1 or approaching "[writing a
commercial-grade penetration testing
report\\\[s](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ewpt-certification/)\]."
The practical test focuses on a penetration test on a corporate network
created from real scenarios. The whole exam targets web application
analysis, advanced abilities to bypass XSS and SQLi filters, and custom
exploits creation skills—both this test and the eWPTv1 last 48 hours.

## [**Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE)**](https://www.offensive-security.com/ctp-osce/)

Granted by Offensive Security.\
In a past blog, [we interviewed Andres Roldan](../recent-osce/), our
Offensive Team Leader, about his experience obtaining this certificate.

It is a **very advanced** certificate. It is the only one on our list
that is on par with the eWPTXv2. The OSCE can be achieved after
obtaining the three previous Offensive Security certificates (OSED,
OSWE, OSEP). However, the same company that awards it also suggests
"[going for this cert after attaining your
OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/ctp-osce/)." The OSCE certifies
that the candidate knows how to discover vulnerabilities using fuzzing
rather than reverse engineering (as we have already said that OSED
does). Unlike the other three Offensive Security certificates, the OSCE
focuses on three areas: web, pentesting and exploit development. This
test does not require a report. From our [Offensive Team Leader
Experience](../osce-journey/), the necessary preparation should be at
least **nine hours** a day studying for **fifty days**. Despite being
one of the most challenging certificates to obtain, it is one scale
below the famous OSEE, one of the most difficult in the world.

With this, we reach every certificate we have obtained to date, and
therefore, the end of our review. We hope it has been helpful. We will
advocate for continuing blogging this kind of post as we continue
obtaining more [certificates](../../certifications/).

We at Fluid Attacks do not stop at our mission to offer the best [Red
Team](../../solutions/red-teaming/) to our clients. That's why we are
constantly facing new challenges and strengthening our [Ethical
Hacking](../../solutions/ethical-hacking/) skills. For more information,
