Earlier this month our CTO, Rafael Alvarez, informed us: _"We’ve
already finished the synthesis of the GDPR standard in Rules_."

What does that mean?

As Danilo Vásquez —Security Analyst at Fluid Attacks— explained to us,
different GDPR requirements, all of which were considered suitable,
became technical requirements for our company. That is, they were
incorporated into Rules.

Let’s clear this up:

Rules was born in **2009** (inspired by [Common
Criteria](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/)) from the combination
of knowledge and "_experience in the field of computer security with
various international standards related to this topic_," according to
Oscar Prado —Cybersecurity Analyst - Releaser at Fluid Attacks.

Rules can be defined —following Danilo— as "_a compendium of
requirements based on the existing security standards_." Not all general
security standards have been covered at this time. Not all of our
requirements are linked to at least one of those standards we have. But
these are things we intend to achieve in the near future.

The technical [requirements](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/requirements/),
apart from those that may be "out-of-scope,"
are linked to what is verifiable through a technical process in a system.
They are those that can be evaluated with [DAST](../../product/dast/),
[SAST](../../product/sast/) or [SCA](../../product/sca/).

The out-of-scope security requirements, which may focus, for example, on
security training and documentation, in contrast, can only be verified
by audits. And although they are not technical, as Oscar says, "_they
play a key role in a security test. For example, the lack of training of
an employee can allow a [phishing](../phishing/) attack to take place_."
Even some of them may later become technical requirements.

The requirements that we have in Rules
have kept a consistent and simple language,
easy to understand.
They allow clients to delimit a [pentesting](../../solutions/penetration-testing/)
or an [ethical hacking](../../solutions/ethical-hacking/) process.
The delimitation will depend on what each client wants to test
and on the concepts of risk and vulnerability that they handle.
The requirements that are chosen determine the stringency
and extent of pentesting,
thus establishing conditions for vulnerability management.

Hackers have in Rules, as Paula Vélez, Security Architect at Fluid Attacks
suggests, "_a performance guide, because if a requirement is
not being satisfied, that means there is a vulnerability to be
reported_." Hacking is made easier; time and effort are saved if the
requirements are found in a single set or single source.

Likewise, clients save time thanks to Rules, as they don’t have to
resort to a multiplicity of standards that fit their security needs. In
Rules, we synthesize, and we handle homogeneity of expression no
matter the diversity of origins of the base standards.

Rules, as a whole, ends up presenting good practices not only to
developers and configurators of products and systems but also to other
members of the organizations that can influence their security. The
requirements serve as a guide from the beginning or in full flow. They
serve to prevent the manifestation or recognize the presence of security
gaps —all this independently of the technology that is being used.

So, we know that many of our requirements are already associated with
one or more reputable standards. But what are these standards that
currently serve us as references? Let’s finish this blog post by
mentioning them.

## Standards

1. [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html)

   Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, [enacted by the
   United States Congress
   in 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act).
   As we found in [a
   guide](https://www.hipaaguide.net/hipaa-for-dummies/), this
   legislation was created, among other objectives, for the
   modernization of the flow of healthcare information. Besides, it was
   for the stipulation of how the PII ([Personally Identifiable
   Information](../pii-leakage-whitehat/)), within the healthcare
   context, should be protected by industries to avoid theft and fraud.
   The HIPAA comprises five essential rules, each with different
   requirements. These rules are: **1)** HIPAA Privacy Rule, **2)**
   HIPAA Security Rule, **3)** Breach Notification Rule, **4)**
   Omnibus Rule, and **5)** Enforcement Rule.

2. [ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)

   The Application Security Verification Standard is a project from the
   Open Web Application Security Project
   ([OWASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OWASP)), an online
   community for the production of freely-available material in the
   field of web app security. ASVS, as we can see on its
   [website](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/),
   "_provides a basis for testing web application technical security
   controls_." It also provides developers with requirements oriented
   to secure development, protecting from vulnerabilities in web apps.
   These requirements can also be used by anyone who wants to build and
   test secure apps.

3. [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/)

   Common Weakness Enumeration, as we found on its
   [website](https://cwe.mitre.org/), "_is a community-developed list
   of common software and hardware security weaknesses_." The CWE
   list serves as a support, with a common language, for the
   identification of vulnerabilities. Such identification is essential
   for their subsequent reduction or repair, and also for prevention.
   The CWE has an orientation towards the communities of development
   and security professionals. It seeks to help ensure that weaknesses
   in software and hardware are remediated before the delivery of
   products, or that they are prevented to avoid putting organizations
   at risk.

4. [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/about-nist)

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology, from the United
   States, has been active for more than a century. NIST provides
   different measurements, standards, and technologies to support a
   variety of scientifically based, human-made products and services,
   regardless of their size and complexity. Inside NIST is the
   Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), and linked to it is the
   National Vulnerability Database
   ([NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/general)). The NVD, created in
   **2000**, "_is the U.S. government repository of standards based
   vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content
   Automation Protocol (SCAP). This data enables automation of
   vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance_.” At
   Fluid Attacks, we are mainly interested in the [NIST Special
   Publication 800-53 (Revision 4)](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4).
   It is a database associated with security and privacy controls for
   federal information systems and organizations.

5. [BSIMM](https://www.bsimm.com/)

   Building Security In Maturity Model, as expressed on its
   [website](https://www.bsimm.com/), "is a study of existing software
   security initiatives _." It quantifies the security practices of
   many organizations and describes a common ground and variations. It
   is a data-driven model resulting from the analysis of those
   initiatives or "\_application/product security programs_" to face
   the challenge of securing the software. BSIMM's descriptive model
   has evolved in line with advances in the field of security. It has
   also grown by collecting and analyzing new data from new companies
   and those with maturing programs. At Fluid Attacks, we use its
   ninth iteration.

6. [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/)

   General Data Protection Regulation is a set of rules within the
   European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) [about
   data protection and
   privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).
   These rules also address the collection, storage, and transfer of
   data from European subjects outside those areas. The GDPR enables
   the unification of international regulations for organizations
   processing personal data of European citizens. It also aims to give
   individuals more control over their personal information and its
   treatment. Companies are required to apply data protection
   principles (using those strictly necessary) in processing activities
   and business practices from the initial stages.
