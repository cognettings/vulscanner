<div class="blog-questions">

Daniel is a highly skilled security professional. His insights about the
current cybersecurity landscape complements previous perspectives on our
blog. Daniel has a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and holds
qualifications such as `OSCP`, `OSCE` and `OSWE`. He recently finished
an `MBA`.

We started this conversation by discussing the main threats companies
face these days.

**What are the leading cybersecurity threats organizations currently
face?**

1. You get to hear that newer threats are based on machine learning
    (`ML`) and artificial intelligence (`AI`), but I disagree. I don’t
    think this is feasible for now. Most of those `ML`-based threats
    seem just marketing to me. A `ML` approach is viable for defense:
    there is 'big data' on network (traffic) and user behavior, required
    to train smart decision algorithms to prevent incidents.

<!-- end list -->

1. Current threats aren’t that different from those we have known for
    years. Organizations are focusing on containing malware. Perhaps,
    two newer variants are worth mentioning: malware that instantly
    wipes data and criptojacking.

<!-- end list -->

1. Common [ransomware](../ransomware/) looks to encrypt data, so that
    crooks can ask for money. In the wiper malware, organizations face
    data availability issues. With the wiper, attackers want to inflict
    damage right away.

**Is *wiper* worse than other types of malware?**

1. Not necessarily. It depends on the data and the backup policies in
    place. As with ransomware, if data is fully backed-up elsewhere,
    there’s no damage. If it’s not, there might be trouble. The
    consequences are usually reputational, and sometimes those are worse
    than financial. An example of the wiper is the *NotPetya*, [which
    caused significant trouble to
    Maersk](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/08/16/notpetya-ransomware-attack-cost-shipping-giant-maersk-over-200-million/#5aa1017f4f9a),
    the Danish shipping company.

At Fluid Attacks,
we blend automation with the best talent in [ethical hacking](../what-is-ethical-hacking/)
to find weaknesses in our customer's systems
by means of our [Continuous Hacking](../../services/continuous-hacking/)
service.
As Daniel says,
hacking skills are still not replaceable by machines.

**And the other variant?**

1. [Cryptojacking](../cryptojacking-malware/). Capturing machines, so
    third party resources are devoted to mine cryptocurrencies.

**What is your opinion of cryptocurrencies?**

1. I believe all financial transactions will be made over blockchain or
    similar technologies sometime in the future. Some big players and
    central banks are doing research and testing with digital
    currencies. They might find an innovative way to make it work with
    current systems. Although I would say this is difficult without
    undermining one of the premises by which bitcoin was proposed back
    in 2008: decentralization.

**What are other threats still out there causing troubles to
organizations and people?**

1. [*Phishing*](../phishing/). [It still makes it to the
    ranks](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/the-top-9-cyber-security-threats-that-will-ruin-your-day/).
    Even with `ML`-based recognition on email providers, browser
    extensions, and endpoint software protections against this threat,
    nothing reduces to a great deal the odds of falling to well crafted
    phishing communications. Human psychology at play.

<!-- end list -->

1. Other relevant threats are those coming from the *supply-chain*,
    often overlooked. All the hardware, a significant proportion of
    software, and many specific software developments aren’t
    proprietary. So, what’s 'inside' is up to suppliers. Let’s say you
    have a data center with hundreds of servers. Nobody has checked the
    suppliers' proprietary chips for malware because nobody does that.
    What do these chips have? Who knows\! In practice, it’s entirely
    possible to program something to be activated in the future that
    causes a harsh incident, or a spectacular hack. And it has happened.
    See, for example, [Meltdown and
    Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/). See how [a telecom company
    found backdoors in home
    equipment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-30/vodafone-found-hidden-backdoors-in-huawei-equipment).
    Rate is high: a study found that [`59%` of companies surveyed had a
    Third-Party Data
    Breach](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181115005665/en/Opus-Ponemon-Institute-Announce-Results-2018-Third-Party).
    And you can keep going: a supplier has at the same time more
    suppliers, and those other suppliers too. The *supply-chain* is
    revealing itself very critical. Think of `IoT` devices in this same
    line of thought: those deploying these devices face complex threats.

1. Application and infrastructure weaknesses will always be major
    threats. As time passes, more and more vulnerabilities are found.
    All that’s man-made is prone to error. We produce chips, create
    software, deploy infrastructure, design security policies. Could
    antivirus software have software weaknesses? Hell yeah, [there are
    plenty of
    examples](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumers-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-symantec-for-defective-antivirus-software-300746568.html).
    It even goes into making it possible for an attacker to gain
    administrative control through the faulty antivirus by leveraging on
    its privileges.

**What do you think are the primarily blind spots when managing
cybersecurity?**

1. I like an analogy: cybersecurity works as a 4-piston engine —
    people, processes, technology, and management. Pistons must be
    synchronized, lubricated, going at the same speed, among others, for
    the engine to work correctly. You can have the best technology,
    systematic processes, and proper management. But, if people fail,
    the whole cybersecurity endeavor fails. People are the piston that
    fails the most. That’s why, I believe, we see so many incidents and
    frauds. People keep clicking malicious links; people still give
    information away they should not. Small actions are all attackers
    need.

**Do you think the problem is that people fall into those attacks?**

1. Not only on those, but people also fall for other untargeted
    attacks. We invest in high technology; we streamline processes;
    managers are conscious and attentive to cybersecurity. But it takes
    only one person to open a breach. Perhaps, we should do more on
    awareness.

**Are awareness programs the solution?**

1. I’m in favor of awareness programs. Nonetheless, it’s not enough to
    focus on employees only. I think we have to start educating at an
    early age about risks in the information, digital, and technology
    domains. As the idiom says, *you can’t teach an old dog new tricks*.

**What about a more interactive approach where people could face a
threat more realistically?**

1. A must. In the [NIST Cybersecurity
    Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), this is
    recommended. Some day I gave a one-hour talk. I described risks and
    how we can prevent them. I showed people
    [websites](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) where they could check if
    their emails have been compromised in well-known incidents. People
    liked it and were engaged. Afterward, we ran a simulation where
    people could fall for a real attack. They didn’t know. A
    non-negligible proportion of attendees, many of them security
    professionals just fell. Just telling people what to do or not, is
    far from enough.

<!-- end list -->

1. But, when people face and feel the downsides of risks, they learn;
    they increase their awareness; they really pay attention to their
    behaviors and change accordingly. People react after their security
    is broken, provided that *the hole* brings palpable consequences.

**How can organizations do better in their pen-testing?**

1. I would recommend two things: focus on testing `IT` assets where an
    incident can endanger operations and the corporate mission. But
    here’s where this suggestion makes real sense: **identifying those
    assets is no easy task**. Not all organizations have this clear.
    Companies should devote time and effort to clarify business
    priorities and failure points in `IT`.

<!-- end list -->

1. Second, use a [red teaming](../../solutions/red-teaming/) approach.
    Diversity of perspective adds
    value. One or two security analysts —a typical setting— could do a
    good job, but a more diverse approach to attacking could mean
    exceptional performance.

We’re grateful to Daniel for this conversation. We hope you have enjoyed
this post, and we look forward to hearing from you. [Do get in touch
