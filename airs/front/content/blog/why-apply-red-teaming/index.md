Are you reluctant to apply red teaming?
Don't you know what it is
and what its value is for the cybersecurity of your organization?

We built this blog post
from the book *[Tribe of Hackers Red Team](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VWHCQMR/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2)*
by Carey and Jin (2019).
We wanted to take as a fundamental pillar
just one of the many questions asked there
to several red teaming experts:
"**How do you explain the value of red teaming
to a reluctant or nontechnical client or organization?**"
Having already written blog posts
on the opinions of five professionals appearing in that book
(i.e., [Carey](../tribe-of-hackers-1/),
[Donnelly](../tribe-of-hackers-2/),
[Weidman](../tribe-of-hackers-3/),
[Secor](../tribe-of-hackers-4/),
and [Perez](../tribe-of-hackers-5/)),
we discarded their answers to that question here.
And we did the same with others
that we didn't find sufficiently meaty or relevant.
Ultimately,
we used the responses of 33 experts.
We hope that what we have put together here will help you change your mind
or broaden your horizons on red teaming,
especially if your answers to the questions
we posed at the beginning
were affirmative.

## Is your organization ready?

Convincing an organization of the value of red teaming
and persuading it to implement it in its cybersecurity programs
can be a burdensome challenge for a service provider.
It may be best not to try to achieve this,
at least not directly.
Ideally,
organizations should look for and turn to the red teams.
But if there is still reluctance or negligence with basic prevention measures,
what could we expect in relation to a more advanced strategy like this?
A security-conscious organization would become informed about it,
mainly while it is in a deliberate process of maturing.
Being mature in security,
it would call upon a red team and its services without ado.
However,
one of the common setbacks is stagnation.

An organization may be unready
and therefore unwilling for red teaming
when the peak of its maturity has so far been [vulnerability assessment](../vulnerability-assessment/)
or [vulnerability management](../what-is-vulnerability-management/).
Some even reach that point
by relying exclusively on automated tools.
Haven't they considered approaches like [risk management](../cvssf-risk-exposure-metric/)
and [attack resistance management](../from-asm-to-arm/) yet?
Perhaps what the expert Chris Gates says is true:
"It's most effective to not waste your time.
In all honesty,
if you have to really push \[...\] and convince,
then the organization isn't going to be in the right \[mindset\]
to receive or implement \[a red team\]."

However,
it is indeed possible to contribute
to the cybersecurity education of organizations.
And this should not be seen as a waste of time.
In fact,
it is something that,
for instance,
we at Fluid Attacks like to do through this and other media.
As the acquisition of red teaming ends up being a business decision,
it is primarily the leaders or directors of organizations
who need to be reached with messages
that are clear enough to them
about the importance of this solution.
Even more so when there are no cybersecurity experts among them
(something that should change;
[the SEC has already suggested it](../sec-new-regulations/)).

As Christopher Campbell puts it,
"The problem is that most people don't understand
what the core mission of a red team is
and instead compare it to other types of testing and assessment."
(If you are among those who are just starting to learn about the subject,
we invite you to read our post "[What Is Red Team in Cyber Security?](../what-is-red-team-in-cyber-security/)")
This method is not meant to replace [vulnerability scanning](../vulnerability-scan/)
or [penetration testing](../what-is-manual-penetration-testing/)
but to *complement* them
at an advanced stage of an organization's security maturity process.
The executives of an organization can be apprised of the different features
and benefits of each of these solutions
(see, for example, [this post](../bas-vs-pentesting-vs-red-teaming/)).
We can contribute to modifying that vision that,
as Jake Williams comments,
is often present in some potential but reluctant customers:
"The red team is seen as an overpriced vulnerability scan
or penetration test."

## Trying to figure out the differences?

From the early stages of an organization's software development lifecycle
(SDLC),
development teams can significantly benefit
from scanning and pentesting.
With different techniques,
these methods target diverse objectives.
Well-known and zero-day vulnerabilities are identified
in the software's source code and operations,
especially in pre-production.
Red teaming,
on the other hand,
is aimed more at a technology that is,
arguably,
ready for its end users
and even at a set of systems or a network in which humans are involved.
However,
it is true that
red teaming focuses more on goals to be achieved
than on specific scopes.
Those who benefit here are all security-related teams,
such as prevention, defense and response teams.

In keeping with the above,
as Brandon McCrillis says,
"Red teaming requires the ability
to combine many aspects of traditional security audits
into an engagement
that crosses the bounds of simply 'checking the compliance box.'"
And as Campbell rightly points out,
"Red teams test how all of your policies and procedures work together
in the actual production environment,
where there are real people."

In that quote above,
there is a key element of the value of red teaming:
the approach to *reality*.
Which reality?
The one relative to cyber threats and bad actors.
A red team is tasked with emulating cybercriminals,
using their resources, techniques, tactics and procedures,
which could do harm to an organization.
As Paul Brager specifies,
"Red teaming allows for an organization
to find potentially damaging or risky holes in their security posture
before bad actors exploit them,
minimizing the potential impact to company reputation,
customers, and shareholders."
This is part of the much-touted-by-us preventive posture.
In the words of Tim MalcomVetter,
the job of a red team "is to prepare the business for the reality
that an attacker may play unfairly
without their knowledge or consent."

With this methodology,
through a trained and supervised team
and with prior approval from the target organization's leadership,
the aim is to evaluate
the effectiveness of the organization's entire security program
(prevention, detection, defense and response)
against attacks as close to reality as possible.
As David Kennedy expresses,
"This is about as real as it gets
without having an actual adversary compromise you."
Ideally,
it is about experiencing one or more hits
but not waiting for them to occur from those "actual adversaries."
Drawing on the sparring analogy used by Chris Nickerson,
with red teaming,
an organization joins a "fight club
to see what it really feels like to be in a fight \[...\].
The entire sentiment of red teaming is to challenge the status quo
â€”not through some type of theoretical or mathematical model
but to learn and evolve through experience."

In a controlled manner,
without putting the target organization at risk,
it can be confronted with simulated adversaries
who act as its real opponents
(no hypothetical attackers).
The organization's teams can then learn from them and,
with that experience,
be more prepared for genuine threats and blows.
Going back to Nickerson:
"It will prepare you for the inevitable fight ahead
and give you trust in your skills.
It will also point out opportunities in your game plan
that may have never been tested."
Also familiar with the sparring analogy,
Robin Wood tops it off with the following:
"A boxer who spends many hours in the ring
trading punches with a willing sparring partner
will be far better prepared for a fight
than one who has only ever hit a punch bag."

## Does it fit your organization's needs?

So,
the red team's purpose is to assess
the true reactions of an organization's technological and human systems
to attacks that border on reality.
Thus,
in order to be realistic,
the red team must know and understand the types of threats
that the industry to which the target organization belongs typically faces.
It must also get a grasp on what previous attacks and incidents have been
or could ever be experienced by that organization.
Since prioritization is a vital issue in cybersecurity,
the red team can find out
what the organization's leaders are most concerned about
and what assets they deem most important.
As McCrillis says,
"The value in red teaming is understanding
and exploiting the business's worst fears."
Already in its offensive exercise,
the red team may even compromise things
that were initially wrongly undervalued by the organization.

The red team focuses on adapting to the context of the target organization
and on identifying those multiple security issues that,
if exploited by criminals,
would have significant and compromising impacts on the organization.
Therefore,
the red team must show flexibility.
As Stephanie Carruthers shares,
"Typically,
companies get penetration tests conducted by a single consultant
who usually has a general skill set.
A red team brings a group of individuals
whose specific skill sets are aligned with the company's infrastructure."
The background of each member of the red team
should determine their involvement
or at least the degree of participation
(for they can also learn)
in a specific project with an organization.
A well-rounded group of experts
with different knowledge and experience
can help to discover even new threats
and suggest which and how
various systems and strategies of the organization
could be improved.

## You're worried about money, huh?

Quite understandably so.
Many organizations may be disinclined to try red teaming
purely because of the cost issue.
They may have already invested in good development practices,
security tools and testing,
and vulnerability management programs.
But,
we could ask them a couple of questions:
Have your investments been sufficient?
Are your prevention,
detection, defense and response capabilities of enough quality?
Bradley Schaufenbuel suggests that
red teaming can be viewed as "a relatively inexpensive way of determining
whether your past investments in people,
process, and technology are providing the results you expected
and what areas of future investment will provide the organization
with the biggest bang for its buck."

On this money issue,
successful red team exercises can help the organization realize
what the costs would be in the event of specific incidents.
(Note that good red teaming that is not "successful"
at achieving precise goals
also counts as a benefit,
revealing that
the target organization's security controls and processes are of high quality).
Large amounts of money can be at stake.
As Kevin Figueroa says,
"showing the cost if the organization is compromised
versus the cost of conducting a red team engagement
may change how they approach security in their organization."
Don't wait until you experience money loss to come to your senses.
Keep in mind what Robert Willis shares:
"Organizations need to be able to justify the spending
that goes into anything cybersecurity related,
which is why many organizations have a horrible security posture."

## We're here to help you!

At Fluid Attacks,
where apart from [red teaming](../../solutions/red-teaming/),
we offer [other cybersecurity solutions](../../solutions/),
we take it as our responsibility to contribute
to eliminating the misconception
that a red team is there to break infrastructures,
blame people for security issues,
provide lengthy reports
and get the hell out of there.
A trustworthy, certified red team is not only there
to compromise systems and expose holes and flaws.
Its work should also include feedback and assistance
to the different sections of the target organization
to help them enhance their security programs.

Don't let your organization get bogged down in cybersecurity maturation.
Don't join those people who,
as Mary Sawyer refers to,
"are only ever going to be concerned about security
when they face the consequences of doing something insecurely."
It's better that your organization,
with the help of a red team,
such as Fluid Attacks',
air out the dirty laundry as soon as possible.
Follow Oddvar Moe's advice:
"It would not be a lot of fun to find out that
an attacker can easily hack into our environment undetected
and isn't stopped
just because we did not test the security of our organization properly."
[Contact us](../../contact-us/)
and start mitigating your organization's risk exposure right now.
