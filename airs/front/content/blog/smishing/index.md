*You just won a car\! Claim it here\!* Probably it is not the first time
you’ve received this type of SMS on your phone. We probably shouldn’t
have to remind you that if you receive something like this, you’d better
not open it\! **Don’t click on any link\!** IT’S A SCAM\! Fly, you
fool\! Fly\! Your financial well-being depends on that. Don’t give away
your money so easily to those who try to seize your keys, credentials,
and personal information.

Smishing is how this type of scam is called. It represents (along with
phishing, vishing, and pharming) $54M in losses just in the United
States (as shown in the FBI Internet Crime Report 2020; see Figure 1.
Also, [click here to know more about what’s in the FBI’s 2020
Report](../fbi-2020-report/)). This is quite frustrating\! It is so much
money and it is so easy to avoid being victims of this type of scam. To
keep criminals from robbing you like this, you must know the modus
operandi of such scams. As the famous writer Frank Herbert said:
*Knowing where the trap is – that’s the first step in evading it.*

Let’s start with the name **smishing**. Since it is a type of scam that
occurs through the Short Message Service (SMS) of our mobiles by
adapting the phishing scam method, it is known as the blend-word
smishing (SMS+phishing). It is a type of cyberattack that tricks victims
into sharing valuable information, installing malware, or giving away
money ([click here for more
info](https://www.csoonline.com/video/104839/what-is-smishing-how-phishing-via-text-message-works)).
This scam has widely spread in various parts of the world. In March of
this year, smishing generated £20-30M losses to the [Newham’s
(UK)](https://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/crime/stratford-money-launderer-jailed-7821216)
largest banks. Last year, the [Bank of
Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/bank-of-ireland-does-u-turn-after-refusal-to-reimburse-smishing-victims-1.4326502)
also had to "reimburse a total of about €800K to as many as 300
customers who have fallen victim to a text «smishing» scam.” But how
could anyone steal information, money or install a malicious program via
a supposedly harmless text message?

## How does smishing work?

Smishing always operates on the same principle: to be a fraudulent
message that motivates the victim to provide information or click a
link. In this way, we could classify this fraud into [three
categories](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3538831/what-is-smishing-how-phishing-via-text-message-works.html):

1. Revealing credentials

    Here, criminals expect victims to provide information about their
    usernames or passwords from certain online accounts. To do so,
    criminals send victims a message that deceives them by saying that
    one of their accounts has been blocked (or will be soon). To avoid
    this situation, victims *"must click on here"* and open a link that
    drives to a facade platform that has fields that must be fulfilled
    with account details. But instead of logging in or rescuing the
    victim’s account, what they just did was give scammers what they
    needed to hack them. Sadly, [bank
    smishing](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3538831/what-is-smishing-how-phishing-via-text-message-works.html)
    is one of the most lucrative and common types of cyberattacks. Today
    scammers have taken advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic and pose as
    health system organizations to deceive people. They ask potential
    victims to provide data for some “medical exams” or to be
    vaccinated. According to the FBI report, smishing (along with
    phishing, vishing, and pharming) was the type of cybercrime with the
    highest number of people affected during 2020 in the United States
    (see Figure 2). It represented an increase of 110% from 2019 (see
    Figure 3). For example, the [Federal Communication Commission
    (FCC)](https://www.fcc.gov/covid-19-text-scams) revealed that $30K
    were being falsely offered as a COVID-19 relief. Something similar
    happened in South Korea where the [Ministry of Science and
    ICT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/south-korea-sees-rise-in-smishing-with-coronavirus-misinformation/)
    revealed in February 2020 that "9,688 smishing texts had been sent
    that used false information on the novel coronavirus."

2. Downloading malware

    In smishing, victims and not scammers do the dirty work. This type
    of scam seeks victims to click on a link to download malicious
    software on their phones. Once inside, they’ll be able to access the
    victim’s location, credit card data, or information from other apps.
    This category is one of the most dangerous since nowadays we tend to
    synchronize all kinds of accounts, contacts, credit information, and
    account credentials on our phones.

3. Sending money to someone

    **Poor friend of yours\!** He crashed into a terrible car accident
    and got lost in the middle of nowhere. There no emergency service
    will rescue him. Will you be *the* good charitable soul who’s going
    to make him a transaction to get him out of that mess?

    This smishing category could be the most infamous one because it
    plays with people’s generosity. In some versions, scammers don’t
    play the victim, but some altruistic religious or a NGO member.
    Anyway, the result is the same: poor dimwits victims with a
    defrauded heart and great tricksters criminals with overflowing joy.
    If these three modalities already sounded familiar to you:
    congratulations\! You’re one step further from being ripped off.
    You’re within the very small percentage of people who know what
    smishing is. A recent [3,500 workers
    survey](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/gtd-pfpt-us-tr-state-of-the-phish-2020.pdf)
    from seven countries (the United States, Australia, France, Germany,
    Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom) showed that only 30% of
    respondents knew what smishing was. Almost a half recognized that
    they didn’t know what that was.

    Now that you know, how can you avoid it?

## Tips to avoid smishing

The **first** and most important one is **do not open any SMS from a
number you don’t know**. If you think it may be real, make sure to get
in touch through official communication channels (bank, health
insurance, etc.). Verify the information sent to you, but NEVER CLICK on
the link provided\!

The second piece of advice is to always keep in mind [three
aspects](https://www.orangecountyscu.org/stories/what-are-smishing-and-vishing/)
related to [bank actions](https://www.hsbc.co.uk/help/security-centre/):

- Banks will never ask you for personal data by SMS.

- Banks will never request credit card information by SMS.

- Banks will never ask you to click on unknown website links.

Lastly: Never think you’re exempt from being a victim\! You must be very
careful as scammers are increasingly refining their methods. In the
scammer world, this type of smishing has become one of the favorites for
several reasons. People often receive lots of SPAM in their mail, which
causes many of unopened emails. Thus **phishing** is becoming less and
less popular. In comparison, we are [less aware of scams via
SMS](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/gtd-pfpt-us-tr-state-of-the-phish-2020.pdf),
so we interact more easily. For us, our phones are very personal and
reliable, contrary to emails that we are more cautious about. Unlike
computers, phones generally do not have firewalls or antiviruses to
hinder such scams.
