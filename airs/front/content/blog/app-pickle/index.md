[`Gherkin`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin)
is a simple language that
can be used for software documentation and testing.
It can be thought of as a tool for
communication between stakeholders and developers which
helps minimize misunderstandings and regressions
through precision in the definition of use-case scenarios.

But `Gherkin` can be used for more than just
software specification and documentation.
In fact, it could be used to
specify any kind of procedure,
from scientific experiments to
how to sew a button.

Here we will focus on
how we can use the Gherkin language to
document attack vectors, or
the way a vulnerability in a system
can be found and exploited.

## Gherkin basics

Most of `Gherkin` is natural language
describing a procedure.
Gherkin supports more than 60 of those.
What gives structure to it are,
at the core level,
the keywords `When` and `Then`,
which are used to specify an event and
its expected outcome. For example:

**A single `Gherkin` 'step'.**

``` gherkin
When I plug my phone into the AC outlet
Then it starts charging
```

Such combinations are
the building blocks of a `Gherkin` file.
The complete file is called a 'feature',
since they are normally used to
describe a single capability
of a piece of software.
But a given feature can have many use cases:
Gherkin calls them 'scenarios'.
In turn, a scenario is made up of
 a (preferably small) number of steps.

``` gherkin
Feature: Make coffee
  Coffee should brew after mixing the ingredients

  Background:
    Given a coffee pot
    And coffee beans
    And water

  Scenario: Make coffee from scratch
    When I grind the coffee
    Then I can put it in the pot
    When I put the coffee and water in the pot
    And I turn it on
    Then coffee should brew
```

As seen above,
the keyword `And`
can be used to replace `When` or `Then`
so as not to have too many of the latter.

Other keywords works as you expect:
they mean
what their natural language counterparts do.
For example,
`Given` is for pre-conditions and
`Background` is used
to apply `Given`
to several scenarios.

Also, as seen above,
you can write in plain language
after a section beginning.
This is useful to explain
what is not expressed by steps and scenarios.
We can also use comments (with `#`),
but only sparingly,
since we’re trying to be
as explicit as possible
about how the feature should work.

## Documenting attack vectors

Now that we have the basics of `Gherkin` under our belts,
let’s see how we can use it
to explain how we can attack and
exploit a vulnerability in a system.

Consider the following website from
[`bWAPP`](link:http://itsecgames.com),
a very buggy web app.

<div class="imgblock">

![bWAPP DNS lookup site](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330660/blog/app-pickle/scr-normal-use-case_p2arvd.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 2. `bWAPP` DNS lookup site

</div>

</div>

It has a very simple function:
give it a valid `URL` and
it prints details about the domain name,
such as its `IP` address.
We can write this up in `Gherkin` as follows:

``` gherkin
Scenario: Normal use case
  Given I am at the page bWAPP/commandi.php
  When I type a valid URL
  Then the IP address of that URL is printed
  When I type any text that is not a URL
  Then there is no output
```

Very simple, yet concrete.
It specifies the expected
behavior of the site
in detail and,
more importantly,
without ambiguities.
Also, this helps avoid support calls,
since the feature file works
as a kind of manual and
troubleshooting guide.

However, we’re here to break that app,
so let’s document that as well.

<div>
<cta-banner
buttontxt="Read more"
link="/solutions/ethical-hacking/"
title="Get started with Fluid Attacks' Ethical Hacking solution right now"
/>
</div>

Let’s see…​
how can the app get all those details?
Actually, the output looks
like that of an `UNIX` command.
If user input is not properly validated,
we could take advantage of that to
execute some other commands in the server.
If, as we expect,
the server executes a **`command`**
with `user_input` as argument,
it’s as if we did this at a terminal:

``` bash
command user_input
```

In `UNIX`-like operating systems,
we can use “;” to execute one command after another.
For example, we can say

``` bash
echo "first line"; echo "second line"
first line
second line
```

and so we have executed two commands in one go.

Thus, if we append
`; another_command arguments`
in the input,
the command executed by the app
would become this:

``` bash
command user_input; another_command arguments
```

Let’s see if that works with
the simple command `ls -aR /`, which
**l**i**s**ts **a**ll files **R**ecursively in **/**,
i.e., all files in the server:

<div class="imgblock">

![Same site, UNIX command injected](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330660/blog/app-pickle/scr-ls-injected_rbvn0e.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 3. `UNIX` command injection in the same site

</div>

</div>

It does\!
If we can \`\`inject'' that command,
a malicious user could definitely
inject more harmful commands.

We can document this entire procedure
(minus the explanations,
which are for the reader’s benefit)
like this:

``` gherkin
Scenario: Dynamic detection and exploitation
  When I type ";ls -aR /" in the field
  Then all files in / are listed recursively
```

We have given this scenario the epithet \`\`dynamic'' since
we found and exploited this vulnerability
by 'dynamically' interacting with the app.
This is in contrast with 'static' detection,
where we find and exploit the bug
by looking into the app’s code,
which is what we’ll do next.

The website is written in `PHP`,
but as long as you can understand any code,
you’re good to go.
Let’s look at the file `commandi.php`.
The lines that execute the command go like this:

``` php
$input = $_POST["target"]
echo shell_exec("nslookup " . $input);
```

So we were right\!
`PHP` asks the server’s shell to
run the command `nslookup`.
The user `$input` is not validated or
changed at all.
That’s why we could exploit
the vulnerability the way we did.

A simple input validation or sanitization
can prevent this
from happening to your app.
If `bWAPP` had added just three lines
to clean the control operators `;`, `&` and `|`:

``` php
$input = str_replace("&", "", $data);
$input = str_replace(";", "", $input);
$input = str_replace("|", "", $input);
```

this vulnerability would have been
a lot harder to exploit, or
just wouldn’t exist.

Combining all the steps above,
we get the full documentation
for this vulnerability
in `Gherkin`:

``` gherkin
Feature: Detect and exploit vulnerability OS Command Injection
  From the bWAPP application
  From the site localhost:80/bWAPP/commandi.php

  Background:
    Given I am running Manjaro GNU/Linux kernel 4.9.77-1-MANJARO
    And I am browsing in Firefox 57.0.4
    And I am runing bWAPP from docker container raesene/bwapp
    Given a PHP site with an input that says "DNS lookup: ____ -> Lookup"

  Scenario: Normal use case
    Given I am at the page bWAPP/commandi.php
    When I type a valid URL
    Then the IP address of that URL is printed
    When I type any text that is not a URL
    Then there is no output

  Scenario: Static detection
    When I look in the code for commandi.php
    Then I see the called function invokes shell_exec("nslookup  ")
    """
    $input = $_POST["target"]
    echo shell_exec("nslookup " . $input);
    """

  Scenario Outline: Dynamic detection and exploitation
    When I append ;<command> to "www.nsa.gov" in the input
    Then the <output> is rendered in the browser

    Examples:
      |       <command>    |       <output>                                  |
      | ls -lR /           | all files in / are listed recursively           |
      | grep -r password / | looks for all ocurrences of "password" in /     |
      | rm -rf             | nothing                                         |
      | vi                 | other pages don't load! server & docker crashed |
```

We wrap long lines
(especially code)
in `Python`-like docstrings (`"""`).
This feature includes the keywords
`Scenario Outline` which is like
having variables in scenarios
in order to avoid repetition.
We use it to show
the output produced by
different commands or trials.

see [Cucumber docs](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference)
for a more thorough,
but still nice and short,
introduction to `Gherkin`.

---
As we’ve seen,
while `Gherkin`
was not exactly designed
with hacking documentation in mind,
we can still make it into a useful tool
for this purpose.
It enables us to write
unambiguous, reproducible and
 — given the right configuration and environment — 
executable documentation that
also simplifies testing.
