In our [last post](../infinite-monkey-fuzzer/), we reproduced the
discovery of a vulnerability in libpng. But that is only a small
library, you might say, with a very limited scope and only 556 KiB
installed. However, many, many packages depend on it. To see how many
packages in the Arch Linux repository depend on `libpng` we can use
`pacgraph` by [Kylee Keen](http://kmkeen.com/pacgraph/):

<div class="imgblock">

!["libpng reverse dependencies"](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1620331100/blog/stand-shoulders-giants/libpng-pacgraph_edml6c.webp)

<div class="title">

More than 14 GiB worth of software depends on `libpng`\! And that is
only in the Arch Linux repositories, which is hardly the most popular
Linux distribution. Also, the library is the official PNG reference
library and is cross-platform, so certainly many other packages in other
operating systems depend on it.

Now, back in 2015 when `libpng` had not yet fixed the low-high palette
bug, all the programs and libraries above were also automatically
vulnerable to the same issue. Actually this is what happened to
Equifax with a vulnerability in Apache Struts. Same with many web
services that use OpenSLL with Heartbleed.

If this could happen to such flagships as
[`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/),
[`qt`](https://www.qt.io/),
[`TeX`](https://services.math.duke.edu/computing/tex/latex.html) and
[`xfce`](https://xfce.org/), it could happen to your organisation. In
fact, this problem is so common
that it is part of the 2017 [OWASP](../../compliance/owasp/) Top 10:
they call it "A9: Using components with known vulnerabilities."

Given the rapid adoption of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) by
large companies, all of a sudden dependency vulnerability appears to be
one [hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) of a problem.
Or rather,
as yuppies would like to point out,
a "business opportunity"?

Many providers of so-called software composition analysis
(SCA)
(don't google it) have since appeared in the security scene.
Some of them are backed by long-standing companies; most are not. In
fact this business has gained such momentum, that it is expected to grow
more than 20% each year from now
[to 2022](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-software-composition-analysis-market-is-expected-to-grow-from-usd-1540-million-in-2017-to-usd-3984-million-by-2022-at-a-compound-annual-growth-rate-cagr-of-209-300595028.html).

What’s worse, it makes the FOSS, that all these companies owe to, look
bad. Yet its adoption is not slowing down and, as we will try to show
here, it’s not its fault but rather, the dependent app’s; and also that
it’s not a FOSS thing but rather that marketing efforts point towards
it.

Today’s applications use on average 30+ libraries, which represent up to
80% of the code.[\[2\]](#r2) Think of it as your code being only a thin
layer upon a building of some tiny, some larger boxes.
What SCA does then is look for vulnerabilities
inside those boxes with information
from external databases,
which then become vulnerabilities in your own app:

Instead of going from the alleged solution towards the source of the
problem, let’s do it backwards.

## The bad

FOSS is developed and used by thousands around the world. This can be
a double-edged blade: on the one hand, according to "Linus's Law,"
bug-finding and patching should be easier as more eyes are involved.

On the other hand, the lack of centralised guiding makes room for bugs.
But then again all kinds of software do.

The difference with proprietary software is that, due to all the
restrictions it is 'less likely' that their bugs will become public as
soon as they would be on the freer side of things. So expect all
vulnerabilities to be zero-day.

So if the source of the problem is not FOSS, what is it? The main
reasons why so many companies suffer from A9:

- Not knowing used dependencies.

- Ignorance of their vulnerabilities.

- No continuous scanning for bugs.

- Not testing for compatibility.

- Component misconfiguration.

In essence, it all boils down to a lack of communication between the
user and the source of the components.

## The good

So what can you do? `OWASP` recommends the following guidelines to
prevent `A9`:[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#r1)

- Trim unnecessary dependencies, features, components etc. That way
  you have less to check.

- Continuously monitor components for updates and vulnerability
  reports.

- Only obtain components from trusted sources.

- Make these guidelines into a company policy.

There are specific tools for this purpose: they compare the version of
the dependency you are using against both remote repositories (to check
for updates) and vulnerability databases (like to find out if any of
your dependencies has reported vulnerabilities that have not been fixed
yet.

- For `JavaScript` you can use
  [`retire.js`](https://github.com/retirejs/retire.js/).

- `Java` users have the
  [`Versions`](http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/) plugin
  for `Maven`.

- Also for `Java` and `.NET`, you can use the [`OWASP Dependency-Check`](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check)
  tool.

- There’s a [Dependency
  check](https://github.com/stevespringett/dependency-check-sonar-plugin/tree/master/examples/single-module-maven)
  `SonarQube` plugin.

Note that the language-specific tools have to be integrated with the
appropriate package manager, like `npm` or `yarn` with `retire`.

A bird’s eye view of how the process should integrate with your
development flow is depicted by the following diagram provided by
Source:Clear.

<div class="imgblock">

We see that every time code is added, the whole system gets scanned for
third-party software vulnerabilities and other issues easily identified
by Static Analysis when code is not available. This is done by following
this procedure:

1. The [SCA](../../product/sca/) identifies the dependencies
   your software is based on.

2. Detect those dependencies versions.

3. Check the dependency master repository for updates.

4. Check one or several vulnerability databases, like
   [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) and [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) or
   their own.

5. Report the findings.

It is a simple process, really.

Notice that the integration is not fully automatic, and it should not
be, since these tools could (and usually do) raise false alarms, so they
are reviewed by human security experts.

Internally, the process of scanning for third party software is the same
for both proprietary and FOSS software, and it is a simple matter of
querying the vulnerabilities databases as described above.

Speaking of integration, you may wonder:
What if my app is deployed inside a container?
"30% of official images in Docker Hub
contain high priority security vulnerabilities,"
according to Pentestit.
Fortunately, there are tools
which go into your container and
perform SCA inside of it (and more), like
[Anchore](http://pentestit.com/anchore-open-source-container-inspection-analysis-system/)
and
[Dockerscan](http://pentestit.com/dockerscan-docker-security-analysis-suite/).

## The ugly

I know you did search for "Software Composition Analysis"
when I suggested you not to.
I just know you did. If you didn’t, good for you\!
Here’s what you’re missing out on:

<div class="imgblock">

All of these industry-leading, award-winning, breakthrough-makers,
oracles of the tech future want to sell you one thing: static code
analysis plus the tools we discussed above.

While static analysis is a valid tool, it’s just a tool. It can scan
code and detect vulnerabilities and unhealthy practices, but also
encourages late detection and produces a lot of false positives.

You could try hiring such a service, and maybe even try to complement it
with dynamic analysis tools like [fuzzing](../infinite-monkey-fuzzer/)
and debuggers, but those have their own issues.

But these are no replacement
for good old-fashioned human [code review](../../solutions/secure-code-review/).
At least at the moment.
According to [\[3\]](#r3%20),

<quote-box>

The only way to deal with the risk of unknown vulnerabilities in
libraries is to have someone who understands security analyse the
source code. Static analysis of libraries is best thought of as
providing hints where security vulnerabilities might be located in the
code, not a replacement for experts.

</quote-box>

In the future,
we might see things
like distributed on-demand
[security testing](../../solutions/security-testing/)
and machine learning algorithms[<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#r2%20) using
support vector machines to try to predict which commits are likely to
open vulnerabilities, but in the meantime, stick to the tried-and-true.
