[Sebastián Revuelta's
webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWKq6n4ZoRY&feature=youtu.be)
is a kind of practical conference in which the author presents one of
the applications created and used in his organization. We will take and
present some of the information that is relevant to us.

Revuelta opens with the question **"why do we need security analysis?"**
In view of this, he gives an account of how the number of
vulnerabilities has been increasing in recent years, which can be
explored and used by hackers to do damage to organizations' systems.
Hence, the answer to the question ends up being: security analysis is
necessary to find security flaws in the system and prevent attacks by
malicious hackers ASAP.

There are different software analysis techniques
that we can employ to find vulnerabilities.
In a [previous post](../fuzzing-forallsecure/)
focused on fuzzing,
we had already mentioned SAST
([Static Application Security Testing](../../product/sast/))
and DAST
([Dynamic Application Security Testing](../../product/dast/)) techniques.
The former,
as Felipe Gómez (LATAM Manager of Fluid Attacks) suggests in a webinar,
is the one we can apply
from the moment our software developer releases the first line of code.
The latter technique is the one we can apply
when the developer has already built a functional environment with the code.

Additionally,
there's a technique called SCA
([Software Composition Analysis](../../product/sca/)).
This is nothing more than an extension of previous techniques,
which [Rafael Ballestas](../stand-shoulders-giants/)
had already told us about,
and which is aimed at Free and Open Source Software (FOSS),
specifically at the elements of this type
that are part of a particular application.
This is an [automated process](https://www.g2.com/product/software-composition-analysis)
for reviewing policy and license compliance,
version updates and security risks.

**Parenthesis**: When we talk about
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software),
we mean software shared openly on the Internet that can be used and
altered in its code in any way by anyone.

For the handling of all the aforementioned types of analysis, Revuelta
refers to an Application Security Testing Orchestration (ASTO) to be
performed on a single platform. However, within his company, the ASTO
is only oriented to the management of SAST and SCA techniques and
their results, referring to the security status of the software in
evaluation.

With the application presented by Revuelta —the Kiuwan Local Analyzer—
the client’s source code is analyzed locally, on his company’s network.
Then, the encrypted results are sent to the Kiuwan cloud.

Once the client runs the Kiuwan app on his system, he can choose one by
one the applications to be analyzed. SAST and SCA can be performed
individually or together. The program can be opened several times at the
same time to make analyses of different applications since the interface
scans one at a time. Within the options, the client can also delimit the
language or languages to be analyzed according to the files under
evaluation. The analysis, it should be noted, is an automatic process of
the software.

Kiuwan’s app also has the option to delimit an "analysis scope," which
can be: 1) baseline, 2) complete delivery, or 3) partial delivery.
Baselines and deliveries are described as two different types of
analysis. The baseline analysis is run when we want to get an image of a
software version. We can make a comparison between a new version of the
software and the previous versions. We can see whether or not we have
improved the security of the software. We can tell whether or not we
have repaired the defects. With this analysis, we obtain an evolutionary
record, positive or negative, of the software in question.

Once the developer has made some minimal changes to the software to be
analyzed, the recommended security analysis for this case ends up being
the delivery one. The Kiuwan application will tell us if that delivery
is accepted or rejected, according to some security gates or checkpoints
previously configured, to be integrated into the baseline or the master
version. The results of all analyses are presented to users on the
Kiuwan website.

All the analysis processes mentioned so far with Kiuwan’s application
can also be performed from the command-line interface. However, in this
blog post, we are not interested in an in-depth description of its
process.

We think it’s important at this point to highlight a couple of things:

Maintaining only the SAST type analysis process (or just combined with
SCA), and only in automatic, can be problematic. SAST often models
the behavior of the code
[inaccurately](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/knowledge-base/sast-dast-iast-and-rasp-how-to-choose/)
and therefore tends to lead to high rates of false positives and false
negatives.

SAST should be a part of a complementary process. Besides, SAST
should not be performed just from a tool. The automatic procedures must
act very well, but only in what we define as 'deterministic'.

At Fluid Attacks, we don't just stick with SAST and SCA. Here we
also perform DAST. Furthermore, it is not that we hand over
the work to an application or a tool that can be useful for any type of
technique. At Fluid Attacks, we extract the best possible from
automatic and manual work,
accomplishing comprehensive [security testing](../../solutions/security-testing/).

The ethical hacking service at Fluid Attacks uses the techniques we
have mentioned, through a team of experts supported by automated tools.
As Kevin Amado —one of the hackers inside Fluid Attacks— shares with
us, the tools automatically search and report. The expert helps at first
a little by directing the tool. What the tool cannot find, is in turn
sought and found through human cleverness.

Also, following what Kevin reports, "_tools find a percentage of the
total, but in the end, it's the human being who decides whether the tool
is right or wrong._" The analysis tools save work, and although they
tell lies many times, it becomes easier to determine those lies, than to
look for the total vulnerabilities by hand, according to Kevin.

Other tools, not oriented to the search for vulnerabilities, serve
instead for other system inspections. They are used for surveys, flow
analysis, or preliminary scans. And other tools are also used to make
the closing exploits; to express whether or not the vulnerabilities in a
system have been remediated, and from that to allow or not the transfer
to production.

The ASTO process
—which at Kiuwan comprises SAST and SCA—
at Fluid Attacks comprises SAST, DAST and SCA,
and is carried out on our platform.
At Fluid Attacks,
to keep false positive and false negative records near zero,
we go beyond the use of automatic tools
and employ human acumen and sagacity.
