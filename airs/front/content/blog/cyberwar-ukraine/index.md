Region?
Europe and Eurasia.
Type of conflict?
Territorial dispute.
Estimated number of casualties?
More than 13,000.
Estimated number of internally displaced people?
1.5 million.
Conflict status?
**Worsening**.
This is the riveting preamble
we find in the Global Conflict Tracker of the U.S. organization
[Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/)
when we try to get information
about the current [conflict](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine)
in Ukraine.

In 2014,
this conflict broke out after protests began
over the Ukrainian president's refusal
to integrate further into the European Union.
Soon after,
he had to flee the country.
Apparently,
[Russia has not wanted](https://theprint.in/world/whats-nato-and-why-does-ukraine-want-to-join/818130/)
such integration to occur
because it would reduce its influence over Ukraine.
Moreover,
if this nation joins [NATO](https://www.nato.int/)
(the North Atlantic Treaty Organization),
the Russians might even see it as a threat.

What's very worrying now is that
[thousands of Russian troops](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/27/world/europe/russia-forces.html)
are occupying the borders with Ukraine.
Although they are not in an invasion process at the moment,
this situation has caused [the U.S. government](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-orders-3-000-troops-to-bolster-european-allies-in-russia-ukraine-crisis-11643810404)
and its allies in Europe
to move their groups of soldiers as well.
Nevertheless,
it's in cyberspace,
which concerns us most here,
where things are moving at a different pace.

## Renewed attacks on the Ukrainian government!

As Professor of Criminology [Robert M. Dover said](https://theconversation.com/ukraine-russia-the-first-shots-have-already-been-fired-in-cyberspace-176051)
a few days ago,
between Ukraine and Russia,
"the first shots have already been fired
â€”in cyberspace."
Of course,
he's referring to the most recent stage of the conflict.
After all,
there have already been fights between these two neighbors
in Eastern Europe
for quite some time.
Likewise,
cyberattacks have also been taking place
in this confrontation
for years.
[For example](https://theconversation.com/ukraine-russia-the-first-shots-have-already-been-fired-in-cyberspace-176051),
in 2015,
Russian hackers took control of a Ukrainian [power grid](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/),
disconnecting more than two thousand people from their heating
during six hours in the middle of winter.
Additionally,
in this blog,
[I once mentioned](../solarwinds-us-strike-back/) that
a Russian intelligence agency was credited
with attacking several systems and networks
in [the Ukrainian](https://www.zdnet.com/article/uk-security-centre-urges-companies-to-boost-their-defences-after-cyberattacks-on-ukraine/)
government,
financial and energy sectors in 2017.
They used the renowned [NotPetya](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/)
malware.
This terrible attack [spread to organizations around the world](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine),
provoking losses of several billion dollars.
Both incidents [could be linked](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/21/1043980/how-a-russian-cyberwar-in-ukraine-could-ripple-out-globally/)
to just the same hacking group:
[Sandworm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandworm_(hacker_group)).
However,
those "first shots" that Dover mentions correspond to assaults
this new year.

Between January 13 and 14,
[according to](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-rozsliduie-prychetnist-rosiiskykh-spetssluzhb-do-sohodnishnoi-kiberataky-na-orhany-derzhavnoi-vlady-ukrainy)
the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU),
in a joint investigation with other state organizations,
more than 70 government websites were attacked.
[These included](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/shchodo-aktak-na-saity-derzhavnykh-orhaniv),
for instance,
the Ministry of Education and Science
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs websites.
There was interference
as well as the publication of provocative messages
on some of the websites
[threatening to upload](https://fortune.com/2022/01/14/hackers-ukraine-government-websites-messages/)
sensitive data to public networks
and inviting people to expect the worst.
However,
it appears there was no leakage of data.
Regardless,
it was decided to temporarily suspend other web resources
to prevent the spread of the attack.
It was referred to as a supply chain attack,
which allegedly began by [exploiting a security vulnerability](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ukraine-says-70-state-websites-were-defaced-10-were-subjected-to-unauthorized-interference/)
in a commercial company's content management system
with privileged access to the affected websites.
From that moment on,
the SSU was already saying that
there were ["certain signs](https://ssu.gov.ua/en/novyny/sbu-rozsliduie-prychetnist-rosiiskykh-spetssluzhb-do-sohodnishnoi-kiberataky-na-orhany-derzhavnoi-vlady-ukrainy)
indicating \[the\] involvement of hacker groups
associated with Russian special services
in the incident."

The seemingly [low magnitude of the impact](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ukraine-says-70-state-websites-were-defaced-10-were-subjected-to-unauthorized-interference/)
of this incident
made some people consider it exaggerated
to speak of a Russian "attack."
But even so,
ministers from different European nations,
such as Belgium, Denmark, Poland and Romania,
condemned what happened
and offered their support to the Ukrainians.
It was the next day
when [Microsoft itself](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/01/15/mstic-malware-cyberattacks-ukraine-government/)
brought to light the fact
that it was not a petty assault.
This renowned multinational corporation informed
they had observed a "destructive malware" in some systems
of the Ukrainian government and other organizations.
As Serhii Demediuk,
the Deputy Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council,
commented later [to the Record](https://therecord.media/a-top-ukrainian-security-official-on-defending-the-nation-against-cyber-attacks/)
in an interview,
the defacing of those websites
"was a red herring to cover up for more destructive actions,
which,
in my opinion,
we will feel in the near future."

## From NotPetya's to WhisperGate's damages

[According to Microsoft's](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)
report,
this malware,
[now called](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/21/1043980/how-a-russian-cyberwar-in-ukraine-could-ripple-out-globally/)
WhisperGate,
was designed to look like ransomware,
but it didn't have a ransom recovery mechanism.
So,
if it was activated,
its mission would be to render the infected systems non-functional.
Since then,
Microsoft began sharing information for organizations
to guide their investigations
and implement defenses.
But how does WhisperGate work?

[WhisperGate acts](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)
as a Master Boot Records (MBR) and content wiper.
(The [MBR](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/mbrlocker-wiper-malware-destructive-pranks-are-no-joke-for-victims/)
is a sector on the disk
that contains the information necessary
for the operating system to boot.)
In the first stage,
WhisperGate overwrites the MBR with a ransom note
and eradicates any recovery options.
In the second stage,
a malicious file corrupter is downloaded,
and it locates specific files on the system
to overwrite their content
["with a fixed](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/)
number of 0xCC bytes
(total file size of 1 MB)"
and rename them "with a seemingly random four-byte extension."
(For a detailed,
four-stage exposition,
[follow this](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/01/ukraine-campaign-delivers-defacement.html)
link.)

Now,
there is a worldwide concern
that something like what NotPetya perpetrated
could happen again with WhisperGate.
[It is said](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/21/1043980/how-a-russian-cyberwar-in-ukraine-could-ripple-out-globally/)
that NotPetya was also a destructive malware masquerading as ransomware.
However,
it was more sophisticated than WhisperGate appears to be.
Anyway,
Russia may again seek to halt the functioning
of infrastructure and entities
essential to the economy,
communication and welfare inside (and outside) Ukraine.
[They might even](https://therecord.media/a-top-ukrainian-security-official-on-defending-the-nation-against-cyber-attacks/)
do so simultaneously with an invasion.
And while some are still discussing
whether the spread of the NotPetya issue was just a circumstantial matter
or an intentional attack also targeting international businesses
connected to Ukraine,
countries such as the U.S.
have already decided to be prepared.

## Are we prepared to deal with a cyberwar?

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) [has already warned](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/21/1043980/how-a-russian-cyberwar-in-ukraine-could-ripple-out-globally/)
critical infrastructure operators
to be alert to these new cyber threats.
From the position of Joe Biden's administration,
the possibility of responding to the cyberattacks
that the Russians will be launching against Ukraine
using U.S. cyber power
is being contemplated.
Who knows,
we could soon be talking about cyberwar
even before an invasion
and a military confrontation takes place.
As O'Neill says in the MIT Technology Review,
["Unlike old-fashioned](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/21/1043980/how-a-russian-cyberwar-in-ukraine-could-ripple-out-globally/)
war,
cyberwar is not confined by borders
and can more easily spiral out of control."

Meanwhile,
let's keep in mind [Demediuk's](https://therecord.media/a-top-ukrainian-security-official-on-defending-the-nation-against-cyber-attacks/)
words:

<quote-box>

I believe that
wherever modern electronic computing technologies are used,
a high level of threat exists,
regardless of the country and its economic well-being.
If you do not pay due attention to cyber defense issues,
then the vulnerability of such structures will be very high.

</quote-box>

And it would help you remember that
[recommendations such as](https://www.zdnet.com/article/uk-security-centre-urges-companies-to-boost-their-defences-after-cyberattacks-on-ukraine/)
keeping software up to date
with all available patches,
enabling multi-factor authentication,
reviewing backups
and having cybersecurity crisis response plans
should remain high on your priority list.
Moreover,
never forget to be aware of currently active threats.
