## Scanning Phase

First, we check the IP of the
[DevOops](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/140) machine
and try a `ping` to see if we have access.

<div class="imgblock">

![ping](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330849/blog/devoops-writeup/ping_s9mmpa.webp)

</div>

Then, we scan the ports with `nmap`. In this case, we’re going to use
basic `nmap`.

**port scannning.**

``` bash
nmap 10.10.10.91
```

And, we see that ports `5000` and `22` are open.

<div class="imgblock">

![ip](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330849/blog/devoops-writeup/nmap_p4mnpl.webp)

</div>

Then, we try to access port `5000` with our browser, and it opens a web
page with the contents of some feed.

<div class="imgblock">

![web-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330849/blog/devoops-writeup/web_dudfix.webp)

</div>

As we can see on this page, there is nothing more than an image there.
So, we’re going to scan the whole web server with `dirbuster` to see if
we can access something useful.

**Searching folders in machine.**

``` bash
dirb http://10.10.10.91:5000
```

<div class="imgblock">

![dirb-scan](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330848/blog/devoops-writeup/dirb_cmg544.webp)

</div>

<div class="imgblock">

![upload-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330846/blog/devoops-writeup/upload-page_ycfqze.webp)

</div>

## Getting user

In the last step, we got an upload page, because the page says we can
upload `XML` files with the tags Author, Subject and Content. Then, we
try to upload the following `XML` file.

**xml.**

``` xml
<post>
<Author>johnarmas</Author>
<Subject>test</Subject>
<heading>Reminder</heading>
<Content>test</Content>
</post>
```

The response of the server is:

<div class="imgblock">

![upload-ok](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330847/blog/devoops-writeup/upload-ok_cknf6r.webp)

</div>

So, because there is no other functionality on the server, we can
suspect that there is an `XML External Entity` (`XXE`) injection. This
is a type of attack against an application that parses `XML` input. This
may lead to, among other issues, the disclosure of confidential data,
and denial of service. We can exploit it to retrieve the contents of
files by uploading a malicious `XML` file.

To test this we can upload the following file:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<post>
<Author>johnarmas</Author>
<Subject>hola</Subject>
<heading>Reminder</heading>
<Content>&xxe;</Content>
</post>
```

With this, we can retrieve the content of `/etc/passwd` from the web
server and test for `XXE` injection. We can do it by manually uploading
the file or using a proxy like `burpsuite` and sending the request to
the repeater, like in this example:

<div class="imgblock">

![upload-passwd](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330849/blog/devoops-writeup/upload-passwd_nji7ye.webp)

</div>

What to do next? When we uploaded our first `XML` file, we could see
from the response that the file is stored on `/home/roosa/deploy/src`.
With this information, we could retrieve the user flag. Usually, this
file is on `/home/roosa/user.txt`, and modifying our `XXE` we could do
it, but what about remote code execution?

title="Get started with Fluid Attacks' Red Teaming solution right now"
/>
</div>

In our scans, we saw port `22` is open, so maybe we could retrieve a
private key to access the server with `ssh`.

In general, the ssh keys are named `id_rsa`, so what happens if we try
to obtain the file `/home/roosa/.ssh/id_rsa`?

<div class="imgblock">

![private-key](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330848/blog/devoops-writeup/private-key_awn4ee.webp)

</div>

We save the content in a file and change the permission to `0600` to be
able to use it with `ssh` without trouble.

We save the content in a file and change the permissions to `0600` to be
able to use it with `ssh` without trouble.

I like `nano`, but it could be with any other text editor. Then, we
access the server with those credentials.

**Access to the server.**

``` bash
nano roosekey
chmod 0600 roosekey
ssh -i roosekey roosa@10.10.10.91
```

<div class="imgblock">

</div>

## Enumerating the server

When we access the server, the first thing we should do is to check the
files and the folders that we can access.

On this server, we can see that there is a folder named `deploy`. Let’s
see what’s in there.

<div class="imgblock">

![enum-folder](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330846/blog/devoops-writeup/enum-folder_ophatw.webp)

</div>

There is another private key, but when we try to elevate it as `root`,
we get an error. So, what could be happening? Let’s see what commands
our user has typed.

<div class="imgblock">

![history](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330848/blog/devoops-writeup/history_kyutfg.webp)

</div>

There we can see that our user has done a `ssh` to `localhost` with the
user `git`. Let’s try the same and see what happens.

<div class="imgblock">

![ssh-git](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330848/blog/devoops-writeup/ssh-git_ulzwsx.webp)

</div>

## Getting root

We do the same with our user `git` to check the history. There is a
command to a route that we didn’t know that is `/srv/git/`. We access
another folder named `blogfeed.git` and check what is in there.

<div class="imgblock">

![enum-folder-git](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330848/blog/devoops-writeup/enum-folder-git_ltxppe.webp)

</div>

It looks like a normal `git` folder, but there is no code in it. Let’s
see what is on their log with:

**Repository log.**

``` bash
git log
```

<div class="imgblock">

![git-log](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330849/blog/devoops-writeup/git-log_hysxnl.webp)

</div>

Surprise, surprise…​

In their log is an authentication key, but to see its content we need to
use `git log` with more verbosity

**Repository log, verbose.**

``` bash
git log -p -8
```

<div class="imgblock">

![auth-key](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330847/blog/devoops-writeup/auth-key_kdkkca.webp)

</div>

When we scroll down, we can see the authentication key. We need to copy
it, remove the trailing plus symbols (only the first one) and then, do
the same with the first key we encounter.

We don’t know which user’s key it is, but we can try to find the `root`
user. It won’t hurt anyone.

<div class="imgblock">

![root](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330847/blog/devoops-writeup/root_am4zjl.webp)

</div>

The key is, in fact, the user’s `root`. So, we can retrieve our `root`
flag, and the challenge is completed.

On this challenge `XXE`, we learned to always check the `history` when
we gain access to a machine as a user, and to check `git` repositories
for credentials.
