"Who is Epik?"
Many website owners have been wondering
since they got a notification last week
from the data breach tracking service [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
(HIBP).
What happened was
that Epik's massive database containing very detailed information
linked to millions of accounts
had been leaked.
Strikingly,
not everyone affected had any relation with Epik.

Let's look at the details.

## Operation EPIK FAIL successful

First off,
[Epik](https://www.epik.com/) is an organization
that provides [domain name registration](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Domain+registrar)
and [web hosting](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/web-hosting).
This means
that they are one of the places other companies go to
in order to register a unique domain name on the Internet
and that they may keep and manage these companies' websites on a server.
On September 13,
independent Journalist Steven Monacelli tweeted a [press release](https://twitter.com/stevanzetti/status/1437482759241469958)
by Anonymous
that was posted on a website
dedicated to what they called "[Operation EPIK FAIL](https://archive.is/Czuu2)."
Anonymous claimed
that they were able to obtain a "decade's worth of data from the company."

On September 14,
when interrogated by [The Record](https://therecord.media/anonymous-hacks-and-leaks-data-from-domain-registrar-epik/),
among others,
Epik's spokesperson said
that they were "not aware of any breach."
The following day,
however,
the company finally [tweeted](https://twitter.com/EpikDotCom/status/1439020408783654917),
confirming that it had been hacked.
That day,
users got a [vague email](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/epik-hack-far-right-sites-anonymous/)
from the CEO acknowledging a "security incident."

by Epik acknowledging the hack.

Now,
why did Anonymous target Epik?
The evidence shows
that the hacktivist group had been motivated
due to the fact that Epik has been hosting websites
where [hate-fueled](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2019/01/11/problem-epik-proportions)
content thrives,
some of which [had been deplatformed](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/texas-abortion-snitch-website-kicked-off-godaddy-for-invading-peoples-privacy/?itm_source=parsely-api)
by other mainstream hosts.
As evidenced by investigative reporter Michael Edison Hayden,
Epik's reputation has to do,
in part,
with its founder and CEO Robert Monster rubbing elbows
with controversial figures.
Some of Epik's [controversial clients](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/epik-data-breach-impacts-15-million-users-including-non-customers/)
have included the Republican Party of Texas, Parler, Gab and 8chan.

According to the description of the hack,
Anonymous leaked [180 gigabytes](https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Epik) of data,
including account credentials,
domain purchases
and payment history.
In the [notice](https://twitter.com/svpndotcom/status/1439456727133474818)
sent to its users,
Epik told them
to look out for "unusual activity" involving their "credit card numbers,
registered names,
user names,
emails,
and passwords."
The admin of a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/epikfailsnippet)
dedicated to the hack [asserted](https://twitter.com/epikfailsnippet/status/1440579325447659526)
that the leaked database is global,
containing information of users from various countries,
not only from the U.S.
This tweet also informed
that the website owners' physical addresses and phone numbers
were among the leaked data.
How much more specific could it be?

A compressed version of the torrent used to download Epik's database
was made [readily available](https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Epik) to everyone.
The Daily Dot downloaded the data and [contacted](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/epik-hack-far-right-sites-anonymous/)
several individuals listed as running various controversial websites.
They confirmed that the information listed in the breach was accurate.
The Daily Dot also talked to an engineer
who conducted an impact assessment for one of Epik's users.
He said that "with all the data in the leak \[…​\]
any attacker could easily take over the websites of countless Epik customers."

## WHOIS compromised?

The official information about the breach [posted in HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites)
indicates that more than 15M accounts were compromised.
We mentioned
that many people who are not Epik's clients were pwned too.
Even HIBP founder, Troy Hunt, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1439705567400894464)
that he is among the people whose information was leaked.
He researched the situation
and concluded that Epik had been [data-scraping](https://www.targetinternet.com/what-is-data-scraping-and-how-can-you-use-it/),
that is,
extracting and harvesting information from people and organizations
who own website domains,
even those who are not its customers.
Troy [informed](https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1439007532287082496)
that Epik scraped this information from the global database of domain holders
called [WHOIS directory](https://who.is/).
This is a public directory,
meaning the information held there is searchable and available for all to see,
in case there's any need to contact a domain owner.

But if WHOIS records can be seen and scraped by anyone,
then why are people who were not Epik's customers so preoccupied?
[Reportedly](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/epik-data-breach-impacts-15-million-users-including-non-customers/),
these people are concerned
that they could be falsely linked with Epik's controversial background.
We would also argue
that malicious hackers may use the leaked information
to try to scam website owners through [social engineering tactics](../social-engineering/).

Another issue is why they were scraping all these data in the first place.
The possibility [has been suggested](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/cyber-security-today-sept-22-2021-epik-breach-has-epic-ramifications-misconfigurations-by-eventbuilder-users-and-phishing-attacks-on-the-aviation-sector/458810)
that Epik saw the database as a source of potential customers
and wanted to pitch them for business.
Epik also appeared to be holding on to this database for a long time.
Ars Technica [took a look](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/epik-data-breach-impacts-15-million-users-including-non-customers/)
at the data
and they "noticed WHOIS records for some domains were dated
and contained incorrect information about domain owners—people
who no longer own these assets."
It's not the first time that breaches show
that some organizations hold on
to the personal information of unsuspecting individuals.
There was the case of Apollo,
a data aggregator and analytics service.
As [reported by WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/apollo-breach-linkedin-salesforce-data/),
security researcher Vinny Troia discovered
that Apollo contained more than 200M contact listings
at the time of its data leak in summer 2018.
Furthermore,
Hunt said about this breach
that more than 100M people had their data leaked
and they didn't even know about Apollo's existence.

## Could it have been prevented?

According to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/epik-website-bug-hacked/),
security researcher Corben Leo had warned Epik about a security vulnerability
as early as January.
Monster acknowledged that he received the warning message,
but he didn't tell whether or not he acted on it.
Apparently,
Anonymous could have actually hacked Epik months ago,
in February,
as suggested by the date of the most recent files in the leaked database.
