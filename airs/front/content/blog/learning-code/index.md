<div class ="blog-questions">

We continue our conversation with Ricardo. We threw him a question that
was the source of interesting debates at Fluid Attacks some time ago.

**Should a company invest in security awareness training?**

1. "You have two options: hiring people with the skills you need or
    supporting people to acquire those skills. People skilled enough in
    cybersecurity are scarce today. My stand here is that companies
    should invest in this; people should have a baseline knowledge of
    digital risks and cybersecurity. Educators should seek to create
    learning experiences. In my case, I feel like playing when I set
    myself to learn something new, and I think that has been crucial for
    advancing in my career. Instead of lectures (or only that), I think
    it’s better to create simulations where employees face what could be
    a real threat, like a phishing scam over email, telephone, or SMS.
    One of the strategies I think is the most effective is to make
    training interactive. For example, by putting people to solve
    challenges, making the training process look like a game."

Fluid Attacks keeps learning through challenges, as Ricardo mentioned,
starting at the hiring process. Take a look at our products, like
asserts and [**Criteria**](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/).

**In cybersecurity strategy, what should organizations start** **and
what should they stop doing?**

1. "Companies should migrate to the cloud if they haven’t done yet. You
    still get to know some companies that remain reluctant to make that
    decision arguing cybersecurity and information risks. But the
    reality is that public cloud providers have better practices
    compared to the typical organization. I would expect that debate to
    end soon.

2. Second, people should start learning to code. Everything is shifting
   towards coding. We have software-defined networks, infrastructure as
   code (IaC) and many other instances where using code makes
   everything so much more powerful and flexible. You can see how this
   is gaining traction in [DevOps](../devops-concept/) roles
   in which a single person performs a combination of software development
   and infrastructure operations.
   I recommend starting with the Python programming language."

I'm pleased Ricardo pointed to the suggestion because cybersecurity will
continue to be increasingly relevant in the global economy and coding is
crucial. [Everyone should learn to
code](https://www.inc.com/andrew-medal/everyone-on-the-planet-should-learn-to-code-heres-why-and-how.html).
For instance, we have seen invitations to [learn to
program](https://thenewmedic.com/why-how-learn-to-code/) in medicine.
Likewise, the recognized statistician Nate Silver said [journalists
should learn to code](https://www.geekwire.com/2014/nate-silver/).

**Now, concerning cybersecurity operations,** **what should companies
start and stop doing?**

1. "Often, people in cybersecurity are seen as the bad guys, as those
    who will disturb your peace by requesting fixes by pointing out
    errors. We have frictions because security is seen as a separate
    entity trying to show what is not OK. Cybersecurity professionals
    **should be those guiding businesses in how to do stuff in a secure
    way** instead of being perceived as those saying *‘it can’t be done
    that way’*.

2. DevOps teams solve some issues IT *siloed* teams usually have.
   What if DevOps teams go further
   by [including security capabilities](../devsecops-concept/)
   (DevSecOps)?
   One way to achieve that is to have security people
   working together with DevOps engineers.
   DevOps teams usually
   have some professionals more skilled in coding; others more
   experienced in infrastructure administration. [Security could be
   another ingredient to provide solutions within DevOps
   teams.](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops)
   Old-fashioned developers usually think they finish their job when an
   application is functionally running. However, from a business
   perspective, that’s not true if other aspects are still missing,
   like quality and security. Organizations should start reconfiguring
   their IT teams to create business resources covering everything in
   synergy: functionality, quality, and security."

**What cybersecurity providers are doing well? What is not so great?**

1. "I can only say Fluid Attacks is doing great stuff, by reinventing
    themselves. They started talking about IaC around four years ago
    mentioning the importance of organizations shifting towards it.
    Benefits are so clear that it’s unthinkable for me taking a
    different path. Here in Australia IaC is unnegotiable, it brings
    speed to service delivery, to development, to infrastructure
    deployment. Fluid Attacks is helping companies to automate the
    detection of weaknesses, working together with development, IT,
    and DevOps teams to infuse security the way I mentioned before. If
    a cybersecurity firm is not into IaC, they will soon lose the
    interesting customers."

Indeed,
Fluid Attacks has a DevOps approach.

**Why do you think companies that know their weaknesses,** **do not fix
them or do it too late?**

1. "I'm pessimistic. Companies fix their weaknesses because they have
    to comply with some regulations. Most people don’t care that their
    software is unsafe. Those responsible for coding blame other people
    or wash their hands, knowing future issues will be fixed by a
    different developer down the line.

2. When accountability disappears, businesses sooner or later are
    forced to face setbacks. Newer costs might appear by detecting
    issues late, and hence other troubles might demand valuable business
    resources. Another reason for that inaction is that we tend to be
    very optimistic, for example, saying *'that happens in other
    companies, not here'*.

**What do you think are relevant misconceptions in cybersecurity?**

1. "A big misconception is that companies should protect primarily from
   individuals targeting your business: *“the attacker”*, *“the
   hacker”*, *“the terrorist”*, etc. A real significant threat is
   malware which works automatically, not necessarily targeted to
   specific firms or people. It is more an entity trying to enter any
   small digital breach. You don’t need declared enemies to protect
   your information and digital assets. It is worrying that there is no
   concrete solution to malware and ransomware yet. The hope for some
   people are potential ML-based solutions [like those tested at
   CERN](../hack-cern/) by our friend Andrés.

2. Another misconception is the notion people have about our field.
   Cybersecurity is not about detecting weaknesses. It is the opposite:
   to build robust systems, less likely to have flaws.

**Security is a behavioral problem; you and I know that.** **What do you
think is the most critical challenge in cybersecurity** **from a
behavioral perspective, and why?**

1. "I would say lack of curiosity or *'critical thinking'*. I find this
    as a good countermeasure for simple mistakes we make that can have a
    huge impact, like getting caught by a phishing attack. There are
    other behaviors you and I have discussed like not fixing weaknesses,
    deploying unhardened servers or program without security practices.

2. Is hard for me to identify a broad reason why people behave as they
    do. But allow me to suggest this: a good way to move groups of
    people towards a better digital behavior is by making security more
    salient, by redefining security metrics. That’s like changing the
    incentives. Some security elements are not that visible, and
    security teams don’t enjoy a good reputation. So, by making security
    more salient, and signaling to some rewards from working towards
    well-thought security standards might be a trick to drive desirable
    behaviors."
