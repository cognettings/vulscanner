So, are you looking to obtain a certification in the cybersecurity
world, but you don't know where to start? Don't worry, here is
everything you should know about the most important certifications in
the field. In this post, we will take a look at almost every
certification Fluid Attacks' members have acquired. So, what we are
about to tell you is based on our experience too.

Let's start with some preliminary clarifications for this and subsequent
posts related to certifications. We have decided to group the
certificates according to their level of difficulty. Of course, the
difficulty of the tests that must be passed to obtain each certificate
can only be determined by the persons who have submitted them. However,
we have considered it worthwhile to give a level within the following
scale: beginner, intermediate and advanced (and the intermediates that
we can identify in the middle of that spectrum).

## [**CompTIA Security+**](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)

Granted by CompTIA. It’s a **beginner** exam.\
It is designed for novice candidates who want to "[pursue an IT security
career](https://www.comptia.org/faq/security/what-is-on-the-comptia-security-exam)."
As its main page says, obtaining the certificate validates that the
candidate has the necessary base "to perform core security functions."
In addition to being introductory, it is a **mandatory certificate** to
fulfill the "[DoD 8570
compliance](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)." The
certificate **expires every three years**, which is why people with
experience in this type of exam usually repeat it. It is a recommended
exam to demonstrate essential cybersecurity knowledge. Each participant
will be [asked
to](https://www.isc2.org/articles/SSCP-vs-SecurityPlus-Compare-Cybersecurity-Certifications)
"perform basic security tasks, including configuring, managing and
troubleshooting networks." Threat identification skills, pentesting and
intrusion detections are fundamental in obtaining this certification.
The exam lasts ninety minutes and is based on multiple choice and
performance-based activities.

## [**Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)**](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/)

Granted by EC-Council. Another **beginner** certificate.\
It is perfect for people who want to make their way into penetration
exams. The preparation level that a candidate must have is practically
the same as that required to achieve CompTIA Security+. However, unlike
the latter, it is not based on multiple-choice questions but has
practical tests. In this sense, it is expected that the tester can put
into practice technical skills and not only theoretical. Unlike
Security+, CEH holders attempt to attack systems with the ultimate
purpose of anticipating cybercriminal attacks and fixing those security
breaches. Another difference between Security+ and CEH is that you have
two options to take the second exam. You **can take the course** before
submitting the exam, or you can **demonstrate two years** of experience.
If you don’t have that experience and don’t want to take the course, you
should consider Security+ first.

In this sense, it could be considered that CEH is slightly more complex
than Security+ since it asks for experience or preparation that the
other does not. In addition, it could be regarded as a much more
specialized certification as people interested in obtaining it must be
professionals working in ethical hacking. Security+ is, in this respect,
much more general, as it "[provides a broad base of knowledge suitable
to multiple
environments](https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/04/04/comptia-security-vs-sscp-cissp-gsec-ccna-ceh/)."
**Both must be renewed three years after being issued**.

## [**Certified DevSecOps Professional (CDP)**](https://www.practical-devsecops.com/certified-devsecops-professional/)

Granted by Practical DevSecOps.\
It is a beginner-intermediate certification.
If most certificates are focused on pentesters
who want to be part of a red team,
the CDP is designed for developers
to strengthen their techniques,
especially those
related with [Development Security Operations](../devsecops-concept/)
([DevSecOps](../../solutions/devsecops/)).
The exam to obtain it
[requires](https://www.practical-devsecops.com/certified-devsecops-professional/)
basic knowledge of Linux commands and an understanding of security
practices such as those of [the OWASP
Top 10](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/compliance/owasp10).
The exam lasts 12 hours. Upon completion, [the
candidates](https://medium.com/devops4me/review-study-guide-certified-devsecops-professional-cdp-be3cf8ae95e5)
"should be able to implement the real DevSecOps approach in the CI/CD
pipeline and doing security tasks at scale."

## [**Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)**](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/)

Granted by Offensive Security.\
It is an **intermediate** level certification and is focused on
practical skills. It certifies that the candidate "[demonstrates a
comprehensive mastery and practical understanding of
pentesting](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/top-5-penetration-testing-certifications-security-professionals/)."
To obtain it, you must pass a completely hands-on exam. In order to
achieve it, it is **mandatory** to take the Penetration Testing [with
Kali Linux (PWK/PEN-200)
course](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/). It is designed
for people who want to strengthen their skills as pentesters. In this
sense, it is recommended to take it after having obtained the CEH. The
exam takes 24 hours of practice tests and 24 hours of writing a report.
That makes it a good candidate for those interested in being prepared
before submitting the longest and most difficult exams. Those usually
last 48 hours.

## [**Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)**](hhttps://www.pentesteracademy.com/activedirectorylab)

Granted by Pentester Academy.\
It is an **intermediate** level certification. In fact, the CRTP is very
close to the OSCP in the level of complexity. To obtain it, candidates
must do an intermediate-level exam that
[requires](https://nileshsapariya.blogspot.com/2020/07/certified-red-team-professional-crtp.html)
to "compromise several machines in a fully patched environment and
produce a well thought out report including mitigations." This test
lasts 24 hours, followed by 48 hours available to write a report on what
has been done. As required by the OSCP, this certificate is entirely
hands-on and focuses on assessing security on [Active
Directory](https://www.quest.com/solutions/active-directory/what-is-active-directory.aspx).
Like Security+ and CEH, it is an exam that **expires after three
years**. With the OSCP and CEH, CRTP is considered the last
certification of the triad needed to start a career within a red team.

## [**Offensive Security Wireless Attacks (OSWP)**](https://www.offensive-security.com/wifu-oswp/)

Granted by Offensive Security.\
It is a **beginner-intermediate** exam. It is usually accomplished after
the CEH and is designed for people who want to consolidate their careers
as security analysts or network administrators. It is an exam that
begins with [lots of
information](https://medium.com/@obikag/my-wifu-journey-oswp-certification-review-a1784730449c)
and reports of [theoretical
training](https://thomfre.dev/my-oswp-experience). The exam focuses on
auditing and testing the security of wireless devices. This makes it
different from other certifications we have reviewed because it is the
only one focused on wireless. Here testers will identify vulnerabilities
in those systems and exploit them for attacks. The exam is limited to
**four hours** and verifies practical skills.

## [**Certified Red Team Expert (CRTE)**](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/redteamlab)

Granted by Pentester Academy.\
In a past blog post, [we interviewed Daniel
Yepes](../new-red-team-expert/) about his experience obtaining this
certificate. It is an **intermediate-advanced** certificate. It usually
follows the OSCP, so it is common for them to be compared. If the OSCP
gave you the fundamental tools to become a pentester, the CRTE takes
that and gets you to the next level. It is usually considered a "[more
realistic](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/oscp-crte-which-one-should-you-take-valentin-giraud)"
test for keeping up with what a true pentester would do in his
day-to-day life. Similar to the CRTP, the CRTE is focused on Active
Directory infrastructure networks. In this sense, both (CRTP and CRTE)
differ from the OSCP because they can give a more general look at how to
exploit vulnerabilities. The examination is 24 hours in length plus 24
hours to the writing exam.
