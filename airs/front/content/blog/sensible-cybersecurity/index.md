In this post, we share the second part of our conversation with Nicolás
Acosta, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of
[Corona.](https://empresa.corona.co/nuestra-compania/quienes-somos) We
spoke about risks, setbacks, and truths and falsehood in cybersecurity.

## Risk Management

Thinking about risks is not easy, and risks are everything in
cybersecurity. Furthermore, fitting cybersecurity risks with those of
business is challenging. We wanted to discuss a bit about this topic
with Nicolás.

**Is it difficult to quantify the risks you manage in monetary terms?**

1. "Remarkably difficult, as is usual in other fields. We have a
    traditional approach, and we face the same common issue:
    prioritization. Which risk is redder than the other reds? We still
    rely on probabilities and impact. Broadly speaking, the current
    approach to risks in cybersecurity has three commonalities: we are
    not good translating hazards to money; we are not good creating
    business cases for cybersecurity —that’s why it’s often perceived as
    costly—; finally, we are not good at achieving approvals for what we
    want to do. As a whole, cybersecurity is poorly understood, and we
    are responsible for that. I’m not saying that we still speak in
    terms of `IT` assets to top management. Nevertheless, in Corona, we
    have started to build a new language to speak directly to the
    business, referring to risks. We have managed to speak in financial
    terms to senior executives by leveraging on the expected loss
    paradigm, something we came across by, among others, exchanging
    ideas with **Fluid Attacks.** Though, it’s still an enormous
    challenge. The *expected loss* indicator is not perfect, and it’s
    complicated to understand. Nevertheless, it’s the best approximation
    we have to speak in business terms. *(Interested in Expected Loss?

    Roundup.](../risk-indicator-roundup/))*

2. In organizations where security breaches translate quickly into
    money, it’s easier to connect the dots. For instance, the risk of a
    successful hack targeting an online banking user with USD `5,000` in
    his account is easy to quantify. However, a scenario where a hack
    reveals personal information or industrial secrets is not
    straightforward to numbers. In the latter, you have to analyze more.
    How much does it cost that someone steals you a food recipe or an
    industrial design? You just try to take what seems more readily
    available, for example, sales forecasts."

## Setbacks

How companies and cybersecurity teams face struggles are diverse.
Nicolás shared with us some of his setbacks as CISO.

**What setback was particularly relevant for you as CISO?**

1. "I think of technical and managerial examples:

2. In one occasion, we should have waited to deploy a protection. We
    proceeded, and in doing so, we also hindered major operations by
    taking down some critical systems. That was never the intention, but
    we ultimately caused the whole financial department of one of our
    companies to be halted for half a day.

3. In another time, it was my first presentation to the board of
    directors. I assumed they were aware enough about cybersecurity, but
    that was plainly not the case. During my presentation, they started
    asking whether my topic was worthy of attention. They simply did not
    understand what I was conveying and I should have started by
    sensitizing the audience

4. What I learned in both instances was pretty clear: not to rush when
    a control or protection is missing; chances are that some blind
    spots play a big role in the middle of the rush. Second, that the
    first contact with a board of directors should be focused on
    sensitization, even if they already are cybersecurity aware. Common
    language must be established from the beginning to succeed in the
    difficult task of speaking to the board."

## Truths and falsehoods in cybersecurity

To conclude our conversation, we talked about what Nicolás consider
false in the discipline, as well as what is true. We wondered what a
CISO like Nicolás could tell us.

**What do you think is a ‘lie’ in cybersecurity,** **but most people
seem to believe in?**

1. "I sometimes see cybersecurity as a cult. For me, cybersecurity is
    not as severe as the market tries to show; people usually
    overestimate what happens. We are not the most targeted
    organization, although we receive daily attacks. And think about our
    size: we are a team of seven protecting a 10,000-people
    organization.

2. When there is ‘no time’? When are circumstances so urgent that you
    can’t even blink? When are we ‘on fire’? It has happened once in the
    last seven years. In my previous job in a bank, it happened twice in
    about the same period. It’s odd: I see a cult of stress, a cult of
    being relevant by being busy. It seems to me like an inertial thing
    that is just not true. I don’t buy that stressful scenario we
    sometimes see on TV or the movies. Sometimes you do have to worry
    about and to act quickly to contain an incident, for sure, but it’s
    not every day, not even every week. In my experience, cybersecurity
    is not that stressful.

3. In this discipline, **you don’t have to do everything.** You can
    leave to randomness some things. Take, for example, theft. Every
    day, people are a victim of some theft. Yet, local institutions
    don’t place a policeman in every corner of the city. That’s the
    value of the expected loss approach because it allows you to better
    weight your actions. **To do nothing** is also a managerial
    decision. Sometimes it’s better to accept that some incidents
    happen, and when they arrive, you deal with them. Not every time you
    get a fever, you go to the doctor. In cybersecurity is the same. We
    need to be sensible about cybersecurity.

4. **Fluid Attacks**, for instance, I’m certain will always manage to
    breach some of my protections in the projects we work together. How
    much do I have to invest to be immune to them? There is no point on
    that. I just accept that fact, and I protect from more likely
    scenarios. The lie is to go until the end. You have to know when to
    stop. Many professionals should discard the **go-until-the-end**
    idea".

**And, what is ‘a truth,’ but most people don’t seem to believe in?**

1. "People and organizations usually think that nothing will ever
    happen to them. You hear from time to time “It will never happen.”
    The truth is that something will happen eventually. The thing is,
    not as many people are aware of cyber risks. For more than 130
    years, some events seemed to have never happened in our
    organization. It’s better to say: for over `130` years, **we’ve
    never known that something has happened.** Botnets exist; ransomware
    exists. If I’m not cautious in my digital behaviors, something
    terrible could happen to me. So, It’s vital to have “healthy”
    digital habits. This is a game of balance, a game where you should
    never feel safe enough that controls just stop making sense, but at
    the same time, a game where you have to be mindful about how much
    you really have to do just for the sake of having a reasonable
    cybersecurity posture."
