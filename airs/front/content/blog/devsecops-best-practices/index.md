[DevSecOps](../what-is-devsecops/)
best practices ensure the implementation of security
into software development and operations.
Organizations that follow these practices enable their teams
to work cooperatively,
build more secure software
and increase development speed.

In this blog post,
we will share our selection of DevSecOps best practices
that you can start implementing or enhancing now.

## Enable collaboration across teams

Adopting a DevSecOps culture and mindset means that people in development,
operations
and security teams work together to release secure software at speed.
The whole point of this shift is to allow seamless communication
and teamwork,
thus encouraging ownership and accountability.

[Implementing DevSecOps](../how-to-implement-devsecops/) means
that every developer is as responsible as anyone on the security team
for the security of the software.
Further,
they can increase their secure coding knowledge
by fixing the issues found by continuous security tests.
The role of the security team is to provide training,
as well as additional help and guidance.
It no longer carries the whole load of security on its shoulders.

## Encourage cybersecurity awareness for everyone

As mentioned before in our [DevSecOps series](../tags/devsecops),
cybersecurity involves not only technology but also people.
Security experts are responsible for implementing
and monitoring security tests to profile cyber risk,
deliver solutions
and assess their effectiveness.
They are also responsible for defining
and complying with the organization's policies.
A DevSecOps mindset is one in which everyone is responsible for security.

As the continuous task of risk management must contemplate
that everyone agrees on their shared responsibility,
organizations need to integrate cybersecurity awareness efforts
to lower the risk of cyberattacks and other incidents.

And what does it mean to foster cybersecurity awareness?
It involves encouraging everyone to recognize cybersecurity problems
and respond accordingly with actions
that have been previously set officially as appropriate.
The following are recommended efforts to promote security awareness
for everyone in the organization:

- Communicate the organization's security policies.

- Educate them about the meaning of the terms that you are using.

- Inform them of their role in protecting information
  and [reporting suspicious activity](../human-security-sensor/).

- Keep them up to date on the different attack vectors
  and their mitigation strategies.

Some of the things you can teach your team include cybersecurity definitions,
the value of information,
access control mechanisms,
password management,
social engineering,
malware,
safe computing
and physical security mechanisms.

## Train in maintaining a secure development process

When it comes to training developers,
these are some actions
that should be executed
by the most reliable team of security experts
in your organization:

- Teach developers the importance of updating software dependencies.

- Teach developers to identify potential vulnerabilities
  in the software design,
  encouraging secure coding.

- Teach developers to fix code vulnerabilities shortly after they're written.
  This involves taking a look at somebody's code
  through [static application security testing](../../product/sast/) (SAST),
  [software composition analysis](../../product/sca/) (SCA)
  or [dynamic application security testing](../../product/dast/) (DAST)
  and then giving education
  relevant to what it is that they're doing wrong.

The software engineering experts
that may help you in carrying out this approach
are commonly known as [Security Champions](../secdevops-security-champions),
who sometimes have the position of [DevSecOps engineers](../what-does-a-devsecops-engineer-do/).

## Implement shift-left testing

DevSecOps is all about integrating security
into every part of information systems engineering
as early as possible in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
This is in contrast to conducting security testing
only in the traditional software testing and production stages.

To achieve the shift-left security approach,
organizations should have security scans built
into the developers' workflow
performed along with continuous manual penetration testing
to search for known vulnerabilities in the code they've just written.
Having a timely report of security issues,
developers can remediate them soon after they arise.

## Launch small code changes quickly and securely

Having security ingrained in all stages of development does not slow it down.
On the contrary,
DevSecOps enables developers to run
a combination of automated and manual tests on their code
and fix any issues promptly,
which minimizes security bottlenecks
(i.e., there are less issues for the security team to solve)
and maximizes speed to launch.
In addition,
developers may become more proficient in secure coding,
which further saves precious time.
Overall,
ensuring that all small changes to code are early tested
helps development to progress steadily and,
ultimately,
faster.

and drivers in implementing DevSecOps,

## Combine manual testing along with automated testing

Process automation is key in the DevSecOps culture.
By automating security testing,
you get the advantage of speeding it up for fast software delivery,
but relying on automation alone
and not combining it
with the expertise of ethical hackers
means low accuracy,
i.e., high rates of false positives and false negatives.
Automated tools
should help experts do the following:

- Categorize and monitor risk across the SDLC.

- Create tickets or issues when vulnerabilities are found.

- Track vulnerability history.

Below are the three most popular assessment methods
that can be executed repeatedly during development
to increase efficiency and security.

### Static application security testing (SAST)

[SAST](../../product/sast/) analyzes the application source code.
Early in the SDLC,
these tests can pinpoint the exact location of vulnerabilities.
They are especially useful to detect issues
such as those concerning lack of data validation,
which open the possibility for an injection attack.

### Dynamic application security testing (DAST)

[DAST](../../product/dast/)
does not require access to the application source code.
It involves assessing running applications
by sending attack vectors to their endpoints.
These tests can detect vulnerabilities
in the application deployment configuration
as well as authentication and session issues,
but they cannot show you the exact location of these security issues in code.

SAST and DAST tools are not advisable on their own,
as they produce reports
with high numbers of false positives and false negatives.
Further,
neither SAST nor DAST tools can find access control issues
(the number one risk to web applications in the [latest OWASP Top 10](../owasp-top-10-2021/)),
whereas [manual security testing](../../solutions/penetration-testing/) can.
Read on to learn more about its benefits.

### Software composition analysis (SCA)

Developing with speed means
you are not spending your time reinventing the wheel.
Therefore,
external dependencies are bound to be used throughout building your technology.
In fact,
they might be used to such an extent
that you probably could not recall each specific dependency.
This is a problem when something major happens,
like the exploitation frenzy of vulnerabilities
found in the popular logging tool [Log4j](../log4shell/),
and everyone has to find out
whether or not they use the vulnerable dependency in their applications.

To mitigate the risks posed by code dependencies
(especially supply chain attacks),
a best practice is to have a complete
and updated inventory of the dependencies
that make up your software
and keep these up-to-date with the latest patches.
The answer to this need is [SCA](../../product/sca/).

SCA requires access to your source code.
It reveals external software dependencies.
So,
this analysis can tell you the component licenses,
versions
and security vulnerabilities,
if there are any.
When performing SCA combining automatic and manual work,
there are no limitations due to coding language,
nor is the analysis limited to commonly known vulnerabilities.

In the DevSecOps culture,
it's a good idea
to perform code dependencies auditing continuously,
early
and across the entire SDLC
to get useful information promptly and continuously
about vulnerable open-source or third-party components.

## Conduct security audits continuously

As threats are evolving continuously,
organizations need to assess their systems thoroughly
to check their compliance with best practices,
international standards
and federal regulations.
As you should expect with this scope,
the assessment is not limited
to checking whether the software in use has the latest patch.
A security audit includes evaluating the integrity
of the systems' physical components,
network security
and employee behavior.

We recommend _continuous_ instead of _regular_ security audits,
since the latter could allow a time window
during which risk exposure could be taken advantage of.
By updating your knowledge of the security weaknesses in your systems,
compliance can be constantly monitored.
By remediating those issues,
it's possible to give your systems more adequate protection from cyberattacks.

## Conduct manual assessments continuously

We encourage you to have experts assess your systems continuously
with techniques such as [manual penetration testing](../../solutions/penetration-testing/).
These involve the work of [ethical hackers](../what-is-ethical-hacking/)
who probe the system to exploit vulnerabilities
and bypass defenses or review code manually
(at Fluid Attacks,
they are aided by AI prioritization),
among other things,
depending on the phase in the SDLC in which the tests are done.
These experts are up to date on tactics used by threat actors
and are able to test
how secure your technology is against attacks
that are tailored for it especially.

Since security reports based on scans made with automated tools
have high rates of false positives
and false negatives,
we immensely value the manual work performed by experts.
To give you an idea,
[our analyses](https://try.fluidattacks.tech/state-of-attacks-2022/)
of security tests performed last year in our clients' systems
show that **67.4% of the risk exposure was reported by manual methods only**.
Thus,
we argue
that penetration testing is a valuable component
in favor of accuracy and depth.

In short,
we advise _continuous_ penetration tests
to validate the security of your technology
and test against new techniques used by threat actors.
This is in contrast to the common advice
to conduct just _regular_ penetration tests
for the sake of complying with regulations,
among other drives.
Continuous assessments support a strong remediation culture,
pushing beyond periodic obligations.

## Break the build

It is advisable to prevent the deployment of a system
if a vulnerability is found in it.
In our [State of Attacks 2022](https://try.fluidattacks.tech/state-of-attacks-2022/),
we reported
that clients who enabled our feature to break the build
**took almost 30% less time**
to remediate their systems' vulnerabilities
than those who didn't enable it.
This is automatic and responds to organization policies
that state how severe a vulnerability should be for it to break the build,
the grace period before a newly reported vulnerability will break the build,
etc.
With this example,
you can see it's worth it to automate tools and processes.
