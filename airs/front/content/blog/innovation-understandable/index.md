## Our guest

Nicolás is the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of
[Corona;](https://empresa.corona.co/nuestra-compania/quienes-somos) a
Colombian Multinational company dedicated to manufacturing ceramics for
home improvement, construction, industry, agriculture, and energy
markets. Corona has 20 production plants in Colombia, 3 in the US, 3 in
México and 3 in Central America.

## AI in cybersecurity

We started by speaking about the emergence of machine learning (`ML`)
and artificial intelligence (`AI`) in cybersecurity, a hot topic right
now.

**What is your opinion on the potential applications of `ML` and `AI`**
**in cybersecurity? Do you believe this potential is real,** **or it is
just a hype?**

1. "My stand is halfway. A hype might be in one end, and a solve-it-all
    approach in the other.

2. I consider `ML` and `AI` as valuable approximations to leverage
    behavioral information for cybersecurity; for instance, to detect
    anomalies. We have a significant restriction with current detection
    systems: they work based on who the user is, not on his/her
    behavior. There is no behavioral baseline. Behavior-based intrusion
    detection enabled by `AI` is a step forward allowing organizations
    to be more efficient.

3. A kind of hype is present in how `IT` providers market their newest
    products and how they describe their applications. Some companies
    suggest something like `ML` and `AI` are the “solution to all
    problems.” Others sell `ML` and `AI` “embodied” as assistants to
    managerial decisions, conveying a robotic way of enforcing security
    policies and containing incidents. I don’t see myself doing that; I
    think we’re not there. Nonetheless, we haven’t learned enough —or
    adequately— about risks from the behavior of the users we protect;
    even less we can program machines to understand and leverage users’
    behavior. The machines’ capability to detect and restrain
    cyberattacks automatically is still far in the future. I think the
    human criterion, the human brain is and will continue to be
    essential for decision-making in cybersecurity. I do not deny these
    capabilities exists. In some `AI-powered` customer service
    applications, you cannot identify easily whether the other party is
    a robot. There are operations in which `ML` and `AI` could add value
    to our business, but I don’t see it as a replacement for high-order
    decision-making."

**Are you deploying `ML` or `AI` for your operations?**

1. "Not yet. Two reasons for that: first, we have made a strategic
    decision not to be early adopters of new technology. We are
    conservative about managing risks, in part due to the market we
    serve. Investing in the latest solutions is expensive. I see other
    fronts where smaller investments have a greater impact on what I do
    with my team. We seek for small, incremental innovations. Second, we
    are not focused on forefront topics, like, for example, those Fluid Attacks
    is concentrated on. Our cybersecurity operations reach a
    variety of technologies. Some are legacy —for example, our core,
    production plants. Others, cutting-edge tech. In this heterogeneous
    environment, it is essential to have a strategy and a vision
    covering all assets.

2. Nevertheless, there is an opportunity in using `AI` in Industrial
    Networks or `OT` (Operational Technology). It should be feasible to
    deploy an `AI` practical application to better support our
    cybersecurity operations.

3. We trust on partners like **Fluid Attacks**, which are doing novel
    work at industry-level. **Fluid Attacks** invests resources in
    exploring and testing with stuff others don’t. Fluid Attacks’
    [Hacking](../../services/continuous-hacking/) services are proof of
    that. A couple of times, I’ve read on the news stuff **Fluid Attacks**
    began to prototype and test months before."

## Innovation in cybersecurity

Even more commonplace than `ML` and `AI`, is innovation. What we do at
Fluid Attacks, many people describe it as innovation. Nicolás mentioned
about innovation at Corona, and we were curious to know more.

**What do you consider you are doing differently in cybersecurity?**
**You mentioned you are convinced about the organization approach** **to
innovation.**

1. "I am a critic of the traditional concept of innovation. Innovation
    is not an end for us; it is an attribute. For Corona, to innovate is
    to make things we already do, but differently; is to start doing
    things we previously didn’t do that support our business goals for
    real. In that way, we make innovation more understandable, more
    worldly; we remove the strange “pedestal,” where traditional
    innovation-speech seem to be. By actively seeking how we can do
    stuff differently, we create innovation, even if it is not new, but
    is disruptive for us, and more importantly, it delivers value to the
    business. We have found (and transformed) processes with no change
    for more than 130 years\!

2. We have to be very assertive in investments in our business. Those
    should be centered mostly on detection capabilities, in knowing what
    is happening. No matter if fixing takes too long after detection.
    Why? Transparency and honesty. This is a responsible way to manage
    cybersecurity risks in a company with a traditional vision of risk
    management because it is easier to ask for resources for protections
    we don’t have." *(Interested in transparency and honesty? Take a
    look at [The F\*CK strategy](../fck-strategy/))*

3. "Last year we had an idea: what if we develop customized software
    for cyberintelligence? We needed to know what was going on beyond
    antivirus or firewalls alerts. We didn’t want to keep looking at
    mere associations among events (malware, the status of servers,
    business rules, etc.). We wanted to go further: to know “the status”
    of business processes from our cybersecurity operations. That
    involves mapping all `IT` assets and creating risk assessments
    quickly and easy to understand to company stakeholders. In other
    words, we wanted to establish a smooth communication to the business
    in the language of business. Think of it, for example, as a risk
    score linked to payroll processes, available before the start of the
    payroll cycle, allowing better decision-making.

4. We worked with another partner in developing a customized solution.
    We turned to agile methodologies, something new for us. The approach
    was so disruptive —in our terms— that it wasn’t necessary to include
    `IT` stakeholders during development. The technology supporting the
    soon-to-be solution was on the cloud and container-based. We avoided
    many committees and discussions. When I presented the product to the
    company, IT was surprised and told us: *“this wasn’t discussed in X,
    Y and Z committees…”* but once they saw the product live, they
    started to fantasize about stuff they could do by working
    *differently.*

5. An almost entirely functional product was serving us in less than
    ten months. And we won Corona’s innovation prize, the Prisma award."

**What does this software provides that you previously did not have?**

1. "Timely detections, quicker reaction. We now identify some
    cybersecurity anomalies in 1.5 hours or 2. Before, we knew about
    breaches two days after incidents. We can now contain attacks when
    they are occurring. For example, for the first time, we could detect
    **Fluid Attacks** in our most recent ethical hacking project."

in which we discuss risk
management, setbacks and lessons,
truths and lies in cybersecurity,
and user behaviors.
