Most of us have faced `AMSI` (Antimalware Scan Interface)
and suffered the constraints it poses
whenever we want to load a fancy PowerShell module like
[PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon)
or
[Invoke-Mimikatz](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Exfiltration)
in the middle of a [Red Team](../../solutions/red-teaming) engagement.

`AMSI` is a programmatic resource offered by Microsoft
to enable an interface to any application
for interacting with any anti-malware product available on the machine.
`AMSI` is EDR-agnostic and can be integrated with any vendor.
When `AMSI` appears on stage,
something like this should be familiar:

<div class="imgblock">

![AMSI in action](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625837510/blog/amsi-bypass/amsi1_glc7wk.webp)

</div>

Programmatically, `AMSI` can be included in an application using
[Win32 API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-functions)
functions and the `IAmsiStream` `COM`
[interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/amsi/nn-amsi-iamsistream).

As a result,
if an application was built with `AMSI`,
`amsi.dll` will become part of the runtime modules of the application.
Hence, it is seen as a `DLL`
that is loaded at runtime when the application starts.
The basic architecture of `AMSI` is the following:

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

Figure 1. Source: [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/how-amsi-helps)

</div>

</div>

As you can see,
the functions responsible for checking the content
for malicious content
are `AmsiScanBuffer()` and `AmsiScanString()`.
These functions act as the entry point
that the application uses
to send the suspected tainted input
to the underlying antivirus software.

Using a tool like [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/),
it is possible to check the runtime modules
on any process in the system.
Checking the process of our PowerShell session,
we can see the `AMSI` `DLL` loaded in memory:

<div class="imgblock">

![AMSI DLL](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625837510/blog/amsi-bypass/amsidll1_mve67c.webp)

</div>

We can also check the exported symbols,
which are the functions provided as the high-level interface with `AMSI`.
Here we can see all the exported functions that compose `AMSI`,
including `AmsiScanBuffer()` and `AmsiScanString()`.

<div class="imgblock">

![AMSI Exports](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625837510/blog/amsi-bypass/amsiexports1_ogosn2.webp)

</div>

However, these two functions are not really different.
In fact, `AmsiScanString()` is a small function
which uses `AmsiScanBuffer()` underneath.
This can be seen in WinDBG:

<div class="imgblock">

![AmsiScanString()](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625837511/blog/amsi-bypass/amsistring0_tdxnw1.webp)

</div>

And with a disassembler:

<div class="imgblock">

![AmsiScanString()](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625837512/blog/amsi-bypass/amsistring1_gityf1.webp)

</div>

So, if we can bypass the checks performed by `AmsiScanBuffer()`,
we can also bypass `AmsiScanString()`\!

Let’s get it done\!

Here, we can see the disassembly graph of `AmsiScanBuffer()`:

<div class="imgblock">

![AmsiScanBuffer()](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625837532/blog/amsi-bypass/amsiscanbuffer1_bqcyo9.webp)

</div>

As you can see, it is not a complex function either.

At the end of the function,
we can see this:

<div class="imgblock">

![AmsiScanBuffer()](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625837510/blog/amsi-bypass/amsiscanbuffer2_oxibne.webp)

</div>

It seems that the actual anti-malware scanning
is performed in the instructions
that compose the big box on the left.
Also, we notice that several `JMP` instructions land in `mov eax 0x800700057`
and then the function ends.
The value `0x80070057` is a standardized error code from Microsoft,
which is `E_INVALIDARG`.
In this case, it’s used by `AmsiScanBuffer()`
to return when the parameters passed by the caller code are not valid.

So, what would happen if we modify the `AmsiScanBuffer()` function in memory
to bypass the anti-malware checking instructions altogether
and force it always to return `0x80070057`?
Let’s check it\!

</div>

First, let’s examine the instructions using WinDBG:

<div class="imgblock">

![AmsiScanBuffer() disassembly](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625837536/blog/amsi-bypass/amsiscanbuffer3_f0sb0r.webp)

</div>

Here we can see the disassembled instructions of `AmsiScanBuffer()`.
We can also see the byte-code
corresponding to the `mov eax,80070057h` instruction: `b857000780`.

Using that information, we can modify the very beginning of
`AmsiScanBuffer()` with the following instructions:

``` x86asm
b857000780          mov eax,0x80070057
c3                  ret
```

That would move the `E_INVALIDARG` value (`0x80070057`) to `EAX`,
making it the return value of `AmsiScanBuffer()`,
and then the function ends with a `RET`.
As can be seen above, the bytes `b857000780` and `c3` are the byte-codes of
those instructions.

We can do the memory patching using [WinDBG](../hevd-dos/).
The steps are the following:

- Attach the current PowerShell session to WinDBG.

- Break the execution.

- Try to load a common flagged module (e.g., `PowerView`) to see
  `AMSI` in action.

- Check the current instructions of the beginning of
  `AmsiScanBuffer()`. This can be accomplished with `u
  amsi!AmsiScanBuffer` inside WinDBG.

- As we are in a little-endian architecture (`x86_64`), we need to
  reverse the byte-code of the `mov eax,0x80070057 | ret`
  instructions: `c380070057b8`.

- Modify the start of `amsi!AmsiScanBuffer` with those bytes. This can
  be done using `eq amsi!AmsiScanBuffer c380070057b8`.

- Resume the execution.

- Load again `PowerView`.

- Enjoy an `AMSI`-free PowerShell session\!

Let’s check the bypass in action:

<div class="imgblock">

![AMSI Bypass](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625837525/blog/amsi-bypass/success1_e0ak8t.webp)

</div>

However,
returning `80070057` is not the only way to bypass `AmsiScanBuffer()`.
In fact, we can make it return `0`,
using something like `sub eax,eax | ret`,
and the bypass will be successful as well.

Let’s see:

<div class="imgblock">

![AMSI Bypass v2](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1625854245/blog/amsi-bypass/success2_zrp8re.webp)

</div>

Success\! Now we can use `PowerView`, `Invoke-Mimikatz`
or any other [Red Team](../../solutions/red-teaming) tool\!

</div>

## Conclusion

Memory patching is a nice trick to use
to modify the behavior of running applications.
Keep in mind that this technique is not persistent.
The modification of `AmsiScanBuffer()`
is performed **on the memory of the PowerView process**
and the original `amsi.dll` is never touched on disk.
