[Andres Roldan](../authors/andres-roldan), our Offensive Team Leader,
did it again\! He earned another certification that proves his expertise
as an **excellent pentester\!** If you want to know more about his
previous certification, you can check out our [post about
OSCE](../recent-osce/).

On this occasion,
we are talking about
the **eLearnSecurity Web application Penetration Tester** certification
(**eWPT**).
It assesses a cybersecurity professional's web application
[penetration testing](../../solutions/penetration-testing/) skill.
The exam is a skill-based test
that requires candidates
to perform a real-world web app pentesting simulation.

[eWPTv1 is
different](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ewpt-certification/) from
conventional certifications because to obtain it, candidates must
perform an exam that simulates what professional pentesters do in real
life. It urges the tester to use every methodology and tool known to
exploit vulnerabilities. At the same time, it is necessary to prove that
the candidate perfectly understands what she is doing. That is why it
requires a detailed report as an essential part of the exam. In it,
testers must provide proof of their findings while writing "a
commercial-grade penetration testing report that correctly identifies
the weaknesses."

We congratulate Andres on this new achievement, and we want to take some
minutes with him to understand his experience taking that exam better.
Concurrently, we want to go deeper into some tips that anyone interested
in doing this exam should consider.

## Interview

<div class="blog-questions">

**What is the exam about, and why did you decide to take it?**

1. The exam is one hundred percent practical. The goal is to find all
   vulnerabilities (focused on web ones) in a scope delivered in a
   letter of engagement. eLearnSecurity says that the evaluation of the
   test is mainly based on the submitted report, which corresponds to a
   document with the highest quality. In it, the tester must sort,
   classify, and detail the vulnerabilities found.

2. The laboratory where the test is done is available for seven days
   from the start of the exam. You have an additional fourteen days to
   submit the report.

3. **As a tip**, it is crucial to understand the scope of the delivered
   document and what it implies (do not try anything different from
   that scope). In fact, eWPTv1 tests the abilities and knowledge that
   we achieve in Fluid Attacks. As a red team, we manually
   search vulnerabilities in a defined target, though we usually
   support that searching with different types of tools.

**Since this test is not multiple-choice questions but involves "[to
perform an actual penetration test](https://cutt.ly/dmfsphm),"** **was
the exam preparation different from other exams you have taken?**

1. My best preparation was my experience doing pentesting in Fluid Attacks.

**That means you did not prepare yourself with the course given by
INE?** **(Considering that INE [“is the premier provider of Technical
Training for the IT industry](https://ine.com/pages/about-us)” and owner
of eLearn Security.)**

1. I didn't prepare with the INE.

**How did you know you were ready to take the exam?**

1. I did not know that. I took the eWPT test to learn about the type of
   eLearnSecurity exams, and it was a pleasant surprise to find that
   the experience gained at Fluid Attacks was enough to earn the
   certification.

**What should we expect from the report that needs to be done as part of
the test?**
**How did you approach it?**

1. The report must be of the best quality. There it would help if you
   described every vulnerability found in the evaluation target. You
   must include screenshots and evidence of exploitation of
   vulnerabilities and impacts obtained.

**Tell us a little about your experience at the time of the exam.**

1. The scan started on May 31, 2021, and **I found all vulnerabilities
   on the same day**. June 1, I prepared the report and presented it on
   June 2 in the morning.

2. The candidate can use any tool during the exam, yet **most
   vulnerabilities are found manually**. Therefore it is vital to know
   how to use the tools to our advantage and not delegate one hundred
   percent of the responsibility to them.

**Will you have to take any certificate renewal exams?**

1. No, this certification has no expiration.

**Any tips for preparing for this particular exam?**

1. If you have more than three years of experience in pentesting, the
   exam will be a "familiar experience." If you do not have that
   experience, I recommend doing the training in INE to find the
   vulnerabilities and generate a quality report.

**What’s next after this certification?**

1. After this, I will keep preparing for other certifications,
   including **eWPTX**, an advanced version of eWPT.

Thank you, Andres, for your time and your clarifications. Again, at
Fluid Attacks, we congratulate you on this achievement\!

As we said before, this is not the first certification that Andres
Roldan obtains. If you are interested in knowing how our Offensive Team
Leader prepared his previous certificate, we recommend reading our post,
“[A Journey to OSCE](../osce-journey/).” Since you are there, we also
recommend you read our last post, in which we interviewed Óscar Uribe
about his experience obtaining the [OSED certification](../).

Finally, we at Fluid Attacks do not stop at our mission to offer the
best [Red Team](../../solutions/red-teaming/) to our clients. That’s why
we are constantly facing new challenges and strengthening our [Ethical
Hacking](../../solutions/ethical-hacking/) skills.

If you want to [know more about the
certifications](../certificates-comparison-i/) that the members of our
Red Team have obtained, you can follow
