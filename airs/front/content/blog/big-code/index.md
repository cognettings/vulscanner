In our [Machine Learning (ML) for secure code
series](../tags/machine-learning) the *mantra* has always been the same:
to figure out how to leverage the power of ML to
detect security vulnerabilities [in source code](../../solutions/secure-code-review/),
regardless of the
[technique](../crash-course-machine-learning), be it [deep
learning](../deep-hacking), [graph mining](../exploit-code-graph),
[natural language processing](../natural-code), or [anomaly
detection](../anomaly-serial-killer-doll).

In this article we present a new player in the field,
[DeepCode](https://www.deepcode.ai/), a system that has exactly this
purpose, combining ML with data flow analysis, namely in the form of
taint analysis.

Taint analysis can come in dynamic and static forms and can be performed
at the source and binary levels, but either way, the goal is the same.
Start by looking at where input comes from and is controlled by the
user, for example, a web app search field. These are named *sources* in
this context. Then, continue to follow the thread to where it gets used
by the system in a security-critical fashion, as in using that info to
query a database, to continue with the previous example. These points
are called *sinks*.

Along the way in the case of a secure application, data should encounter
significant input sanitization or validation. These are called
*sanitizers* in the taint analysis context. However, frequently this
does not happen, and thus vulnerabilities arise.

Traditional taint analysis tools, however, usually present high false
positive rates, as is the case with
[Bandit](https://github.com/openstack/bandit) and
[Pyt](https://github.com/python-security/pyt) (see some critique
[here](https://smarketshq.com/avoiding-injection-with-taint-analysis-1e55429e207b)).

DeepCode’s purpose is to remove minor difficulties these taint
analysis tools may have. DeepCode does this by learning from the vast
quantity of freely-available, high-quality code in open repositories
such as [Github](https://github.com/), a circumstance then dubbed "Big
Code". The tool is easy and free to use. This provides the added
advantage of also learning from the user’s code, the suggestions made by
the tool, and the user’s feedback (accepting suggestions, *how* to fix
them, etc).

Another problem with taint analysis is that sources, sinks, and
sanitizers need to be specified by hand, which is extremely impractical
for large-scale projects. This is another area where ML helps
DeepCode, but how is that done?

DeepCode has been called [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) for
code. It claims to be 90% accurate, and that it understands the *intent*
behind the code. It also claims to find twice as many issues as other
tools, even some critical ones (XSS, SQL injection and path
traversal, etc.) which is something typical static analysis tools do
not. Moreover, it claims to be easy to use, requiring no configuration.

The tool is friendly. You need only point it to your repository and give
the appropriate permissions, and then it will show a dashboard with the
issues found. Here is one for [Eclipse Che Cloud
IDE](https://github.com/eclipse/che):

<div class="imgblock">

![Dashboard for Eclipse Che](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330670/blog/big-code/che-dashboard_chqwbk.webp)

demo](https://www.deepcode.ai/app/gh/eclipse/che/5be0e29f11fdef73ed4a3da5fe61e3cc0eb3e875/_/dashboard/).

</div>

</div>

Here we see three instances of a possible path traversal vulnerability.
In the full dashboard, we also see how they report an insecure HTTPS
channel, a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), a Cross Site Scripting
(XSS) vulnerability, and a header that leaks technical information
(X-Powered-By). And that’s only the issues tagged as "security". There
are also API misuse issues, v.g. using `Thread.run()` instead of
`Thread.start()`, general bugs or defects, and now they even throw lint
tools results, which deal with formatting and presentation issues. Oh,
yes, and every issue comes with a possible fix you might implement right
away.

Quite nice, from the point of view of contributing a new vulnerability
report to a project, with no false positives. However when the aim is to
find *all* vulnerabilities, one cannot help but raise the question: is
that all? Are these *all* the security vulnerabilities in a project with
more than [300,000](https://api.codetabs.com/v1/loc?github=eclipse/che)
lines of code?

Let us take one of the many Vulnerable by Design (VbD) applications we
use for training purposes in our [challenges
site](https://autonomicmind.com/challenges/sites-ranking-vbd/), and see
how many vulnerabilities come up by running DeepCode on them. By the
way, they currently support Javascript, TypeScript and Java,
besides the original Python. That leaves us with two apps to try: the
[Damn Vulnerable NodeJS Application](https://github.com/appsecco/dvna)
(DVNA) and [Damn Small Vulnerable
Web](https://github.com/stamparm/DSVW) (DSVW), since most VbD apps
are built with PHP.

</div>

I forked both of these on Github, signed up for a DeepCode account,
and let it run. For DSVW, which is a single Python file under 100
lines of code, but still ridden with vulnerabilities, DeepCode reports
zero issues. Perhaps it does not work as well on such tiny projects.

<div class="imgblock">

<div class="title">

Figure 3. Zero issues in DSVW.

</div>

</div>

This is, to say the least, disappointing, since that DSVW has no less
than 26 different *kinds* of vulnerabilities, as per its README. In
[Writeups](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/tree/master/vbd/dsvw/),
three of those have been manually explored and exploited.

Maybe it’s a problem with having so few lines of code, maybe it’s a
Python thing, so let’s try the other one: DVNA, built with NodeJS
with the specific purpose of demonstrating the [OWASP Top 10
vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_Top_10).

This time around, DeepCode found 9 issues. Of those, take out the 3
which come from `ESLint`, and let’s consider the other 6; 2 are API
misuses, which are basically "use arrows instead of functions" and 4 are
security vulnerabilities, and pretty serious ones at that:

- Code Injection via `eval` function in calculator module. Not the
  same one as in the authors' security guide. Also not yet reported in
  [Writeups](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/tree/master/vbd/dvna/)
  This should be researched further.

- SQL injection. As per [security
  guide](https://github.com/appsecco/dvna/blob/master/docs/solution/a1-injection.md)
  and
  [Writeups](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/blob/master/vbd/dvna/0564-sql-injection/jicardona.feature).

- Open Redirect. Also in [the security
  guide](https://github.com/appsecco/dvna/blob/master/docs/solution/ax-unvalidated-redirects-and-forwards.md)
  and
  [Writeups](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/blob/master/vbd/dvna/0601-unvalidated-redirects/simongomez95.feature).

- Technical information leakage via the X-Powered-By header, as in
  `Che`.

So, altogether, 3 noteworthy security vulnerabilities, in a NodeJS
application with more than 7,500 lines of code. In
[Writeups](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups), at least 29
different vulnerabilities have been reported in DVNA. You can see a
[report](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/writeups/blob/master/vbd/dvna/results-toe.md)
on manual testing vs the LGTM [code-as-data](../oracle-code) tool in
there, too, where it is quite clear that tool misses most of the
vulnerabilities as well.

Now for a more realistic test, let’s try running DeepCode on some of
our own repos, namely, Integrates, our platform for vulnerability
centralization and management and
[asserts](https://fluidattacks.gitlab.io/asserts/), our vulnerability
automation framework. Both are
[open-source](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks), written in Python, and
actively developed. As before, the vast majority of issues found by
DeepCode are of the lint and API usage kind.

<div class="title">

Figure 4. Integrates Dashboard

</div>

</div>

In Integrates,
the platform that our clients use for [vulnerability management](../../solutions/vulnerability-management/),
we see a possible command injection in the spreadsheet
report generation function. However, this input is not controllable by
the user, so this does not pose a real threat at the moment:

**Command Injection in Integrates?.**

<div class="imgblock">

![Command Injection in Integrates?](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330669/blog/big-code/reports.py_nubki3.webp)

</div>

However, the suggestion to sanitize the input via `subprocess.call()` is
not bad. Who knows if Integrates will later have user-configurable
passwords for reports, or a *different* vulnerability enables an
attacker to change this parameter.

The other security issue is in the PDF report generation, this time
identified as Path traversal. Again, probably difficult to exploit,
but should be sanitized anyway.

<div class="imgblock">

![Asserts Dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620330669/blog/big-code/asserts_vtzc8h.webp)

</div>

In [Asserts](https://fluidattacks.gitlab.io/asserts/), however, the 15
issues found by DeepCode are less worrisome, for two reasons:

- [Asserts](https://fluidattacks.gitlab.io/asserts/) is not a
  client-server application, but an API that runs locally.

- Most of the 15 issues are several instances of SSRF, when
  [Asserts](https://fluidattacks.gitlab.io/asserts/) makes HTTP
  requests via [Requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/),
  generally to client’s ToEs as one would in a browser.

Of course, all the issues detected by DeepCode will be taken care of.

---
Once again, this confirms our other *mantra* we have held in this
[Machine Learning (ML) series](../tags/machine-learning) and also
[elsewhere](../replaced-machines/) [on
our](../../about-us/differentiators/#method)
[website](../importance-pentesting/). While automated tools, even
ML-powered ones, may have the potential to do what a human could not
do in terms of repetitions and scalability, as of yet, they do not have
the malice or creativity which humans have in finding critical and
interesting security vulnerabilities.
