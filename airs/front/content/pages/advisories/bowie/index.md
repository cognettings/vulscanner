## Description

Popcorn Time 0.4.7 has a Stored XSS in the `Movies API Server(s)`
field via the `settings` page. The `nodeIntegration` configuration
is set to **on** which allows the webpage to use `NodeJs` features,
an attacker can leverage this to run OS commands.

## Proof of Concept

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open the Popcorn time application.

2. Go to `settings`.

3. Enable `Show advanced settings`.

4. Scroll down to the `API Server(s)` section.

5. Insert the following PoC inside the `Movies API Server(s)`
   field and click on `Check for updates`.

```javascript
a"><script>require('child_process').exec('calc');</script>
```

6. Scroll down to the `Database` section and click on
   `Export database`.

7. The application will create a `.zip` file with
   the current configuration.

8. Send the configuration to the victim.

9. The victim must go to `Settings -> Database`
   and click on `Import Database`

10. When the victim restarts the application the XSS
    will be triggered and will run the `calc` command.

* Version: Popcorn Time 0.4.7.
