## Description

Uvdesk version 1.1.1 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to exploit
a stored XSS in the application. This is possible because the application
does not correctly validate the message sent by the clients in the ticket.

## Vulnerability

This vulnerability occurs because the application does not correctly validate
the message sent by the clients in the ticket.

## Exploitation

We must send the payload xss through the ticket message. It is important to use
a proxy here, because the payload will be encoded from javascript.
