## Description

OrangeScrum version 2.0.11 allows an authenticated external attacker to
delete arbitrary local files from the server. This is possible because
the application uses an unsanitized attacker-controlled parameter to
construct an internal path.

## Vulnerability

This vulnerability occurs because the application uses an unsanitized
attacker-controlled parameter to construct an internal path.

## Exploit

To exploit this vulnerability, we only need to send the following
malicious malicious request to the server.

```txt
