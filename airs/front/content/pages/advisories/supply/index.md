## Description

Uvdesk version 1.1.1 allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute
commands on the server. This is possible because the application does not
properly validate profile pictures uploaded by customers.

## Vulnerability

This vulnerability occurs because the application does not properly validate
profile pictures uploaded by customers.

## Exploitation

The application only accepts images (validates content and mimetype), however
it does not correctly validate the image extension. Thanks to this we can inject
PHP code in the image comments (so as not to corrupt it), and then through a
proxy we change the image extension to `.php`.
