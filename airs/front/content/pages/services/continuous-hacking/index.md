description: Our Continuous Hacking detects and reports vulnerabilities and security issues during the whole software development lifecycle.
keywords: Fluid Attacks, Services, Continuous Hacking, Ethical Hacking, Security, Software Development Lifecycle, Pentesting
template: service
definition: We detect and report vulnerabilities and security issues during the whole software development lifecycle. With this method, we perform comprehensive testing, detecting security issues continuously as software evolves. The inspection is done with very low rates of false positives and ensures previous issues were resolved before going to production.
subtext: Based on the characteristics of your project, you may decide that the right choice is to check for vulnerabilities across the entire software development lifecycle. We offer comprehensive security tests that combine automation, AI and our ethical hackers' expertise to continuously detect and report your system's vulnerabilities as it evolves. This method gives you the advantage of reducing vulnerability remediation costs by 90% if the testing starts at the early stages of development.

### Break the Build in Your CI

We can break the build in your CI, obliging developers to fix the open
vulnerabilities in order to deploy.
With just one click in our **platform**,
leaders can decide which vulnerabilities are crucial
and must break the build in their CI
if they are still open.

### Critical Information Extraction and Information Removal

Information extraction is done to maximize the impacts of the finding.
The data gathered during a subscription remains on our platform. Your
subscription's admin is allowed to delete it. The data is removed **30**
days after the admin’s decision. This operation can be reversed during
those **30** days. In that time, no user (even the admin) has access to
the group’s data unless the operation is reversed.

### Severity of Tested Requirements

You can decide through
[**Criteria**](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/) which security
requirements will be tested. You can know the exact severity of each
hacking project (for inspected and uninspected profiled requirements).

### Hacking Techniques, Team, Duration and Cycles

Continuous hacking means automatic and manual testing with speed. It is
done through the ethical hacking of the apps, the infrastructure, and
the source code. **Fluid Attacks** makes Zero-Day findings and reports
minimal rates of false positives. The testing needs access to the
**Git** repository and the integration environment. The selected system
is attacked repeatedly to test all existing versions by using various
techniques such as **SAST**, **DAST**, **SCA** and **CSPM**.

### Health Check

All versions of existing code should be attacked up to the subscription
start point, in addition to the monthly test limit. A health check is
scheduled in order to catch up with the development team. Then, the
continuous hacking advances simultaneously with the development.

### Remediation

Fluid Attacks performs multiple finding validations. You can check at
any time if any of the findings have been closed. To perform remediation
validation: First, you must define the treatment used to remediate the
vulnerability.
Then,
you must request,
through our platform,
a finding validation.
You can always resolve any doubts
by contacting Fluid Attacks directly.

</div>

### A single platform

Our platform allows control in the testing and
remediation processes of vulnerabilities. It can be used to access
general data on each finding. It also allows you to check the findings'
remediation status and classify them by age. In addition, it displays
stats and project progress in real time, among other things.
