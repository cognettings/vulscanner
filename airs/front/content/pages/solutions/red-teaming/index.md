Fluid Attacks
establishes with your organization specific objectives
and sets out to attack its systems and security controls
to find out the effectiveness of its attack prevention,
detection and response strategies.
The holistic nature of this approach means
it would often need for the personnel,
and not only the technology,
to also be put to the test (e.g., through social engineering).
This allows the red teaming simulation to be as close to reality as possible.
Also for this purpose,
our ethical hackers,
who hold several certifications in offensive security,
employ up-to-date tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP)
to simulate attacks
that cybercriminals may conduct against your organization.
Based on what they find,
we can then provide you with advice
to determine the best ways
to resolve your systems' weaknesses
and improve your protection against the countless,
constant internal and external threats in cybersecurity.

## Red Teaming FAQs

<faq-container>

<div>
<solution-faq

>

A red team is a group of offensive security specialists
that simulates cyberattacks against the same organizations that employ it,
targeting not only their IT systems but also their employees
and security controls in their physical facilities.

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is red team and blue team in cyber security?"
>

Whereas a red team is a group of experts
that conducts offensive attacks to realize specific objectives,
a blue team is a group of defensive security specialists
whose job is to assess the target organization's security
and organize, implement and improve controls
that would help fend it from the red team and other attackers.

</solution-faq>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is a red team exercise?"
>

Red team exercises are attack simulations
where the red team advances offensively toward specific objectives
agreed upon between it and the target organization,
who,
in turn,
must respond defensively.
The red team simulations are done with the consent
of the organization's executive leadership,
although,
ideally,
the incident response team,
employees and security staff do not know this.
