Fluid Attacks' Security Testing solution
allows for the accurate detection of security vulnerabilities
in your IT infrastructure,
applications and source code.
While other security testing solutions focus on applying a single method,
Fluid Attacks offers comprehensive assessments through SAST,
DAST and SCA, leveraging the combination of tools and human expertise.
Our security testing team consists
of certified ethical hackers
who work in diverse environments
to perform reverse engineering,
manual penetration testing and exploitation.
Our approach allows us to deliver reports
that contain minimal rates of false positives and false negatives.

We conduct security testing continuously,
early
and throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).
You can find all the results of our assessments
along with helpful details
on Fluid Attacks' platform.
Among this information,
our hacking team provides you with recommendations
and guidance on their remediation
in order to mitigate the risks of cyberattacks
from internal and external sources.
Every time you have implemented the fixes,
you can ask us to perform reattacks
to assess their effectiveness.

## Security Testing FAQs

<faq-container>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="How to perform security testing?"
>

Security testing should be comprehensive
and performed continuously throughout the entire SDLC.
Depending on the phase,
some methods will be more appropriate than others.
So,
for example,
SAST is advised from the code phase onward,
SCA from the building phase onward,
DAST from the testing phase onward,
and so on.
The application of these methods
should not rely exclusively on automated tools.
They should also be performed
and reviewed for accuracy manually.
After remediating vulnerabilities,
security testing should be performed again
to verify the effectiveness of the remediation
and find new vulnerabilities.

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="Do automated tools hack?"
>

We argue that no tool hacks.
Even though suites have been invented
to run particular exploits
(i.e., code strings that have been proven to take advantage of a vulnerability)
also written by hackers,
there always needs to be a human behind these tools
who knows which exploit to use in any given context.

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="How do false positives impact the software development process?"
>

False positives can be a hindrance
as their analysis can be time consuming and frustrating.
Moreover,
developers may start to lose confidence
in the reports generated by the security testing tool or method.
Also,
if it is within an organization's policy to break the build
(i.e., to interrupt the delivery of vulnerable code to production),
false positives can be a false alarm
that triggers this action,
resulting in setbacks for development.

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="How do false negatives impact the software development process?"
>

False negatives can contribute to an organization's false sense of security.
Moreover,
moving into production with these vulnerabilities means
that malicious attackers could exploit them,
and remediation costs would be higher than in development phases.
