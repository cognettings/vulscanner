We offer the integration of security
into the development + operations (DevOps) methodology
during the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
As opposed to many DevSecOps solutions,
at Fluid Attacks,
we are not entirely dependent on tools
and place more value on our ethical hackers' skills
to ensure greater accuracy in testing.
We recognize that speed without precision is useless.

Our security solutions in your DevSecOps integration
can help optimize your development process
from the first uploaded commit
and continue doing so after the software is in production.
You can rely on us
to discover how exposed your systems are to risk.
We do this through penetration testing,
reverse engineering
and automated methods such as SAST,
SCA and DAST.
DevSecOps with Fluid Attacks is a cultural change
within your organization
where every team member can become convinced
that security is everyone's responsibility.

## DevSecOps FAQs

<faq-container>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What does DevSecOps stand for?">

DevSecOps stands for "development," "security" and "operations."

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is DevSecOps methodology?">

Teams doing DevSecOps focus on bringing security
to every stage of the development and operations cycle,
implementing practices
that ensure that software is secure before every deployment.

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="Why is DevSecOps important?">

As the number of cyber threats and the cost of cyberattacks skyrocket,
it is necessary to understand
that system security is just as important as functionality and innovation.
By committing to security from the early stages of the SDLC,
teams reduce time spent on remediation,
as well as its associated costs,
and create technology that is secure for users.

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What are the advantages of DevSecOps vs. DevOps?">

DevOps enables collaboration between the development and operations teams
to increase the frequency of deployments,
but security is usually left to be assessed
only at the end of each release.
DevSecOps brings the security team's work
from the very beginning of the project.
Some advantages include a decrease in remediation costs,
as vulnerabilities are found and fixed earlier,
continuous improvement in secure coding
and greater expansion of shared responsibility.

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="How to implement DevSecOps?">

DevSecOps is a whole culture
in which you will need to incrementally enable the development,
operations and security teams
to collaborate,
shift security considerations to earlier stages of development,
conduct training on secure coding,
perform security assessments
and remediation,
decide on security-driven policies,
among other practices.
We offer a detailed roadmap
in our [dedicated blog post](../../blog/how-to-implement-devsecops/).

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What are DevSecOps best practices?">

Actions that support your implementation of security throughout the SDLC
include making everyone across teams aware
of their accountability for security,
leveraging human knowledge
to quickly and continuously test small changes to the system
for vulnerabilities,
and preventing vulnerable changes from being deployed.
Learn about these and more practices
in our [dedicated blog post](../../blog/devsecops-best-practices/).

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="How are application security testing tools used in DevSecOps?">

Tools can be used in combination with manual assessments
in the implementation of security testing
throughout the development and operations cycle.
Our recommendation is that always,
including in DevSecOps,
security tools be used in combination with manual pentesting.
Some security testing techniques may be conducted earlier than others.
For example,
SAST can be done manually in combination with tools
as soon as there's code to review,
but manual and automated DAST can be introduced only
if there's a build artifact to attack.
Learn more about how we use DevSecOps tools
in combination with manual security testing
in our [dedicated blog post](../../blog/devsecops-tools/).
