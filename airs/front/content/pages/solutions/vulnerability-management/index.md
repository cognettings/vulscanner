At Fluid Attacks, we offer the Vulnerability Management solution,
which combines advanced scanning software with
our ethical hackers' ability to identify and report
the vulnerabilities in organizations' information systems.
This process
—supported by our platform through which our reports are delivered—
can provide fundamental insight
into your company's cybersecurity.
It can indicate how well it is protected against potential threats,
which issues need to be prioritized or addressed most urgently
and which have already been resolved.

We recognize
that having few vulnerabilities
does not necessarily equal being less exposed to cyberattacks.
Indeed,
having only one vulnerability,
and that one being rated critical,
could be more dangerous
than having ten of low severity.
On our platform,
we provide you with each vulnerability's
[CVSSF](https://try.fluidattacks.tech/report/cvssf/) score.
The CVSSF is a metric we created
that slightly adjusts the CVSS score
so that values follow an exponential scale
and better represent how vulnerabilities differ in the risk they cause.
By calculating the aggregated CVSSF value,
our Vulnerability Management solution gives you a measure of security status
based on risk exposure.

Our Vulnerability Management solution can be part of
your entire software development lifecycle (SDLC),
especially in a Continuous Hacking process.
In this service,
we initially assess superficial and deterministic vulnerabilities and then,
through our experts' work, proceed to the identification of deeper,
more complex and even zero-day vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Management FAQs

<faq-container>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is vulnerability management?">

It refers to a continuous process of identifying
and characterizing security vulnerabilities,
as well as reporting on and remediating them.
It is therefore an important part of a proactive
and preventive cybersecurity posture,
in which efforts are made to address vulnerabilities
before threat actors have a chance to find out they exist.

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is a vulnerability management program?">

It is a framework that organizations plan to follow
in order to discover, understand and address vulnerabilities.
At Fluid Attacks we encourage you
to include in such programs
policies that state that security testing be comprehensive
(i.e., using different methods manually and through automated tools),
continuous
(i.e., instead of just a one-shot affair)
and close to reality
(i.e., conducting red teaming exercises
in which the organization's prevention,
detection and response strategies
are tested at the technological and human levels).

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is risk-based vulnerability management?">

It is an approach
in which security vulnerabilities are understood
and prioritized in terms of the risk exposure they represent in a system,
thus distancing from a previous approach
in which the whole point of managing vulnerabilities is limited
to reducing their number.
