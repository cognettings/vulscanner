Fluid Attacks' comprehensive Penetration Testing solution
is based on our certified pentesters' ability
to simulate real-world cyberattacks
in order to infiltrate companies' software and information assets.
Our pentesters look for and try to exploit security vulnerabilities
in your systems
and then provide you with detailed reports
that can assist you in their proper elimination.

Contrary to other penetration testing solutions,
our pentesting is not an automated activity.
Fluid Attacks' professionals make use of security
and penetration testing tools
and rely on their expertise
to apply manual security testing techniques.
Therefore,
this kind of testing focuses much more on vulnerabilities
that cannot be discovered through automated scanning methods,
which are oriented to find known weaknesses.
Our hackers know the latest and most intricate techniques
threat actors use to attack,
and penetration testing is the perfect way to find out
whether your system is effectively secured against them.

## Penetration Testing FAQs

<faq-container>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is penetration testing?">

It is the simulation of genuine attacks
to test the security of a system with the permission of its owners.
This method often involves creating custom exploits
with the goal of bypassing defenses.
That is why
it can be as accurate
as the skills of the ethical hackers performing it allow it to be.
We perform continuous pentesting,
which means
that our professionals test your systems permanently as you make changes.

</solution-faq>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is the primary purpose of penetration testing?">

It is to find business-critical vulnerabilities in information systems
by using the same techniques and way of thinking of malicious hackers.

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is the end result of a penetration test?">

Penetration tests reveal complex vulnerabilities
that are often more severe than those found by automated tools alone.
The result is a more realistic view of the security of information systems.
If it is performed continuously and early in the software development lifecycle
(SDLC),
as we do not tire of recommending,
then you can eliminate spots through which malicious hackers could get in
before moving into production.

</solution-faq>
</div>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="What is manual pentesting?">

We argue that automated tools cannot perform penetration testing.
Therefore,
manual pen testing is the only kind there is.
So the answer to this question is the same
as that to the first question of this FAQ.
Remember,
vulnerability scanning cannot do
what shines the brightest in manual penetration testing: simulation
of real attack scenarios.
