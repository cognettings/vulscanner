Fluid Attacks' Secure Code Review solution
provides you with a comprehensive review of your software's source code.
Specifically,
this solution is intended to identify
whether your lines of code are following required coding standards
and whether there are security flaws or vulnerabilities
that need to be remediated promptly
to prevent any cyberattack.
We employ a diverse set of security testing techniques,
including SAST and SCA,
always using a combination of automatic and manual processes
to achieve these objectives.
Through our comprehensive secure code review methodology,
we minimize false negatives
and deliver reports with very low rates of false positives.

Contrary to common practice,
the Secure Code Review solution is applied to your applications' code
from the early stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
and at a continuous pace.
This means our solution offers an advantage
over traditional secure code review services,
prompting you to reduce security risks before the software is released,
thus avoiding future costs of remediation.

## Secure Code Review FAQs

<faq-container>

<div>
<solution-faq
  title="How to do code review?"
>

Your team should be reviewing source code
from the very moment they start writing it.
The main goal is to reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks
due to code vulnerabilities that emerge during the development cycle.
The source code review process should be constant
and involve a combination of scanning by automated tool
and manual assessments
so that every vulnerability is found and properly confirmed.
Automation helps find known and simple vulnerabilities,
saving time for security analysts,
while the manual technique helps examine the code in context and intention
to identify unknown and complex vulnerabilities
and validate the tool scan results.

<solution-faq
  title="What security requirements do you check when doing source code review?"
>

At Fluid Attacks,
we compile our own
list of requirements —which are written as specific objectives— upon revision
of several international standards related to information security.
Among these standards are
the OWASP Secure Coding Practices Reference Guide (OWASP SCP),
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
Some of the requirements we check are:
removing commented-out code,
excluding unverifiable files (e.g., binaries),
verifying that the versions of third-party components in use are stable,
tested and up to date,
and many others.
