[CRT](https://www.crest-approved.org/certification-careers/crest-certifications/crest-registered-penetration-tester/)
is a certification created by CREST.
Candidates must pass both a theoretical and a practical examination,
proving they have the technical knowledge and the actual skill
to carry out vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
In the hands-on section,
they must find the vulnerabilities across network,
application and database technologies.
A valid CPSA pass is a prerequisite for the CRT.
