[C)PTC](https://www.mile2.com/cptc_outline/)
is a certification created by Mile2.
In order to earn it,
candidates must prove their expertise in penetration testing
by exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities,
bypassing security mechanisms such as ASLR and DEP,
personalizing existing exploits
and chaining vulnerabilities together
to elevate privileges.
Additionally,
they must pass a theoretical exam
focused on advanced penetration testing and exploitation concepts.
