[eJPT](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/)
is a certification created by eLearnSecurity.
It certifies
that the individual has the essential skills
to conduct penetration testing.
The exam is entirely hands-on,
modeled after real-world scenarios.
It demands actions such as vulnerability assessment of networks
and web applications,
manual exploitation of the latter
and using Metasploit to perform attacks.
