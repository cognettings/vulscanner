[OSED](https://www.offensive-security.com/exp301-osed/)
is an exploit development certification,
created by Offensive Security.
It is one of three certifications
that make up the new OSCE3 certification,
along with the OSWE for web application security
and the OSEP for penetration testing.
In an intense 48-hour exam,
professionals prove they can find bugs in a binary application
and build an exploit from scratch,
craft exploits for common security mitigations
and use the technique to bypass data execution.
