[CRTM](https://www.alteredsecurity.com/gcb)
is a fully hands-on certification issued by Altered Security.
To earn it,
the person has to find vulnerabilities and then fix them.
Succeeding involves skills
that include abusing Windows technologies
that are not targeted in most certifications,
like LAPS, WSL, JEA, WDAC, ASR, CLM and MS Exchange.
