[GXPN](https://www.giac.org/certifications/exploit-researcher-advanced-penetration-tester-gxpn/)
is a certification
issued by Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC).
Candidates must pass an exam
proving their advanced penetration testing skills
and knowledge about exploitation.
These include bypassing network access control systems
and using protocol fuzzing
to discover weaknesses in a target system,
as well as attacking and exploiting common flaws
in cryptographic implementations.
Completing the exam questions requires hands-on skills
and the performance of tasks mimicking reality.
