[BSCP](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification)
is a certification created by PortSwigger's Web Security Academy.
Individuals awarded the BSCP demonstrate their knowledge and skills
in identifying and exploiting multiple common web vulnerabilities
(e.g., HTTP request smuggling, XSS, and SQL injection).
In a four-hour exam
(prior to which preparation and practice steps are available),
they must cleverly use Burp Suite,
a web application security testing toolkit developed by PortSwigger.
