[OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/ctp-osce/)
is a certification focused on advanced penetration testing skills,
created by Offensive Security.
In an intense 48-hour exam,
the professionals prove they can develop exploits,
execute attacks
and obtain administrative access.
OSCEs can think outside the box
and perform with persistence,
even under pressure.
