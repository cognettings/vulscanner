[CRTO](https://eu.badgr.com/public/badges/Od2nC1yPRPaDC9UCJ8W7Lg)
is a certification created by Zero-Point Security.
In order to earn it,
candidates must pass a 48-hour practical examination
in which they prove
they can achieve multiple domain takeovers.
They must be able to provide an adversarial perspective,
challenging assumptions
that an organization makes about its security practices,
and identify areas that need improvement
in its operational defense.
