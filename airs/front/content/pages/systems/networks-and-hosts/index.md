The information flows that organizations usually establish and maintain
in the current market are supported by external and internal networks.
Fluid Attacks can check these infrastructures for your company, with
the primary objective of finding security vulnerabilities that can
represent different risk levels for your information assets and other
resources. Our red team applies automatic scans and manual attacks
following techniques such as SAST, DAST and Pentesting. They can
discover misconfigurations in servers, ports or file transfer protocols,
outdated components and other flaws that cybercriminals can follow and
take advantage of in order to cause direct or indirect damage to your
company.

Our network security testing focuses on services, hosts and devices of
your internal and external networks (e.g., PCs, servers, VPNs, DNSs,
apps, routers, IoT). First, it analyzes a general structure with its
access points and then it checks each software element’s weaknesses,
always taking into account the malicious hacker’s mindset, since at
`Fluid Attacks` we are established as a red team.
