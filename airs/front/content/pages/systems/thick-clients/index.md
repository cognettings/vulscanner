Thick client applications are those in which most of the operations and
information processing occurs on the client side, regardless of whether
they are connected to a network or not. In organizations, security
testing tends to be primarily oriented towards mobile and web
applications (‘thin clients’), sometimes overlooking the security
weaknesses or vulnerabilities that thick clients may possess (e.g.,
injection, memory corruption, cryptographic issues). These
vulnerabilities could affect both client-side and server-side systems.

At Fluid Attacks, we can also help you detect vulnerabilities in your
thick client applications. During the first steps of an application’s
assessment, we identify the technologies used, the functions and
processes it carries out, and the security mechanisms employed. Then, we
take into account risks and potential attack vectors and employ testing
techniques, such as SAST, DAST, and SCA, mixing automation and manual
operation, as well as more complicated procedures such as Pentesting. We
intend to evaluate configurations and processes of interaction and
communication in networks, making sure to analyze both client and
server-side software.
