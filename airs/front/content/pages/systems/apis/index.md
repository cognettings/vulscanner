APIs and microservices play essential roles in the applications. APIs
(application programming interfaces) define and facilitate data exchange
between different software components and change the way we interact
with applications. On the other hand, microservices, which are smaller,
independent units or containers in the applications with few and closely
related jobs, facilitate the building, functioning and maintenance of
the applications. Both APIs and microservices can be vulnerable to
cyberattacks. When either of them are part of or constitute an
application, they represent multiple potential attack vectors for
malicious hackers. Therefore, each of these elements should be evaluated
continuously, considering every line of their code, ideally from the
early development stages.

Here is where we come in to act in favor of microservice and API
security. Our team of ethical hackers uses diverse techniques, among
which, for these cases, SAST, DAST and Manual Pentesting stand out.
Interactions between microservices, their functions, business logic and
the public exposition of APIs on the networks have to be tracked and
attacked to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited by
cybercriminals. The scanning and testing procedures pay attention to
running applicationsâ€™ behavior, covering authentication, authorization
and encryption functions, among others, always taking into account more
vulnerabilities than those usually publicly highlighted, for instance by
the OWASP Top 10.
