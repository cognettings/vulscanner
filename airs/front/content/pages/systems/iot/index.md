<div class="paragraph fw3 f5 lh-2">

IoT devices (e.g., cameras, scanners, sensors, vehicles) are becoming
increasingly part of many organizations’ infrastructure, but this is
happening in some cases without considering the necessary security
measures and standards for software development and hardware
implementation. That’s why these solutions may have a negative impact on
the security of business networks (sometimes with overestimated
privacy), making them more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. If
hackers succeed in breaking into just one of the intelligent devices
belonging to the network, they may also be able to reach other connected
objects and even the main server. So, security assessments must be
carried out on each device present in your infrastructure and on each
new incorporation; this is in addition to what has to be done on your
network.

Here at Fluid Attacks, we can help you with IoT devices’ continuous
analyses using automatic scanning processes and manual hacking
techniques, including SAST, DAST and Penetration Testing. We seek to
detect all the vulnerabilities present in your devices, APIs and
server-side applications through superficial evaluations and in-depth
attacks. We pay attention to misconfigurations, insecure protocols and
communication channels, and out-of-date firmware, among many other flaws
that can put your company’s and users’ information assets at risk.
