<div class="paragraph fw3 f5 lh-2">

Operational Technology (OT) contrasts with Information Technology (IT)
because, although both use hardware and software, the former monitors
the industrial physical processes, equipment and infrastructure, while
the latter controls the storage and data flow. OT is related to
industrial control systems (ICS), among which we find supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems as one of the most commonly
used.

<div class="paragraph fw3 f5 lh-2">

It is in these types of systems, which collect data from sensors and
send it to central systems, that we perform security testing at Fluid Attacks,
considering the possible risks that your company may face
related to the connection between OT and IT networks with the Internet.
The OT security testing by our ethical hackers involves mainly the DAST
and the Manual Pentesting techniques. Our network and system assessments
can be critical in preventing malicious hackers from impacting OT
environments and jeopardizing not only industrial organizations’
productivity and efficacy but also, and more importantly, workers’ and
perhaps even customers’ safety.
