Like any other software, web applications can be susceptible to showing
vulnerabilities that put organizations’ and their clients’ information
assets at risk. Our ethical hackers target these vulnerabilities before
cybercriminals have the opportunity to exploit them. To ensure a fast
remediation process, you should not depend on defense by firewalls and
should look for weaknesses in your applications’ security features and
other functions, and even in the open-source software associated with
them.

<div class="paragraph fw3 f5 lh-2">

Our web application security testing goes beyond the most popular
cybersecurity vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and is performed from
different perspectives, not only by automated tools but mainly by
multiple members of our red team, following techniques such as SAST,
DAST and SCA. In addition, we manually test and attack your web
applications performing the Penetration Testing technique, going deeper,
finding the more complex vulnerabilities (including those in the
business logic of the app) and helping to avoid false positives and
false negatives. Fluid Attacks’ web application security testing can
also be included in your software development lifecycle (SDLC) if your
company is responsible for developing these applications.
