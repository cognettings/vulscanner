<div class="paragraph fw3 f5 lh-2">

The use of mobile devices has grown dramatically in recent years. This
has gone in tandem with the increase of mobile applications (we are
talking about millions) that day by day compete wildly in the market
offering their services. Our high dependence on this type of technology
has led to an increasing amount of sensitive information at risk.
Companies that build or manage mobile applications are responsible for
thinking about and applying cybersecurity, not only complying with basic
standards but also guaranteeing almost entirely secure systems that
prevent data leakages.

<div class="paragraph fw3 f5 lh-2">

Fluid Attacks can help you with this mission through the work of our
ethical hackers. With great skill and creativity, they are able to
detect security vulnerabilities in your applications —for iOS, Android
or Windows UI— for prompt remediation. We employ techniques like SAST,
DAST and SCA, both automatic and manual, but we can also make use
of more complex methods, such as Pentesting and Software Reverse
Engineering (if there is no source code), to comprehensively and
accurately assess your mobile applications.

In this case, the vulnerabilities to find are almost the same as for web
applications, so we do not keep a narrow focus on OWASP Top 10 Mobile
vulnerabilities or other popular lists. Our mobile application security
testing can be part of your SDLC, if you are developing, in order to
continuously assess your lines of code before going to production. We
can maintain evaluations during the accelerated update processes of the
applications that respond to the users’ needs.
