It is common today for many companies to move their systems and
applications to the cloud, seeking benefits of higher speed and reduced
costs. Nevertheless, cloud infrastructure can also mean important, new
security issues that need to be resolved and that are different from
on-premises models’ issues. These can include configuration, application
and network weaknesses and flaws that malicious hackers can exploit to
reach sensitive data and may disrupt your infrastructure’s operational
flow.

Our cloud security testing, which involves automatic and manual
techniques such as SAST, DAST, SCA and CSPM, does not have any problem
if your information assets are hosted on Azure, GCP, AWS or another
cloud. It is our responsibility to identify vulnerabilities in your
infrastructure beyond the OWASP Top 10, so we use Manual Pentesting to
go deeper. We simulate cyberattacks, evaluating the architecture and
integrity of your security controls, the capabilities to detect and
respond to threats, as well as the infrastructure’s functionalities
which are susceptible to being exploited.
