definition: Fluid Attacks' cloud security posture management (CSPM) involves continuously assessing your software's compliance with cloud security requirements across several standards, as well as giving information to help prioritize issues and making recommendations on remediation. CSPM begins early in development, covering the detection of security issues in your IaC scripts, container images and runtime environments, as well as misconfigurations of cloud services. We inform you of the risk exposure that each security issue represents and provide you with analytics that help you in your decision-making to prioritize remediation.

### Manage security risks to your cloud adoption

We detect issues like excessive privileges,
exposed credentials,
unencrypted data
and unrestricted ports,
among several others.
Further,
we enable their prioritization and the assignment of their remediation.
Later,
we conduct reassessments to verify they are fixed.
This way you can effectively manage risks
such as improper configuration and use of identities and cloud entitlements,
unauthorized access,
account hijacking
and external data sharing.

belonging to several well-known international security standards
and guidelines
(e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, NIST, NYDFS, CIS, SOC 2, OWASP, CWE, NERC, CAPEC,
ISO/IEC 27002).

### An element of comprehensive tests

In our Machine Plan,
CSPM is complemented by static application security testing (SAST),
dynamic application security testing (DAST)
and software composition analysis (SCA).
In our Squad Plan
—our most comprehensive offering—
CSPM is complemented by manual penetration testing (MPT)
and reverse engineering (RE).
We perform security testing throughout your SDLC
in both plans.
