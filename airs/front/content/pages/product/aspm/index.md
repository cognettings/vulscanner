definition: ASPM is a relatively recent approach to AppSec that, according to Gartner, was "formerly known as application security orchestration and correlation" (ASOC). ASOC was one of the first solutions that centralized risk or vulnerability reports taken from multiple AST (application security testing) tools. ASPM goes beyond the purpose of ASOC, aiming to achieve better risk contextualization, prioritization and management within companies and help them strengthen their cybersecurity postures.
defaux: Fluid Attacks' ASPM is supported on a single platform. On this platform, the procedures of our automated tools and ethical hackers are managed, and their assessment results throughout our clients' software development lifecycles are consolidated and correlated. While the ASPM approach works at the application level, which may or may not be hosted in a cloud, our platform also receives the findings from our CSPM tests. CSPM works at an underlying level corresponding to the cloud infrastructure and, together with ASPM, allows a comprehensive view of the security statuses of companies' applications and systems.

### AST that keeps pace with application development

To respond promptly to your customers' needs,
the changes your development teams make to your company's applications
can be constant and accelerated.
Our ASPM offers you continuous security testing and reporting
from the start and throughout the SDLC
to prevent bottlenecks when changes are going into production,
reduce remediation costs
and help avoid security incidents.

### Results consolidation and analysis in one place

You don't have to keep track of separate AppSec operations and findings
coming from silos.
In our platform,
we integrate all the tools at our disposal,
and their results are analyzed and correlated with each other
and with those obtained by our more in-depth MPT.
Therefore,
your teams save time by not collecting results from different sources,
identifying duplicates or false positives,
and prioritizing risks based on their own analysis.

### Detailed reports and remediation support

Our multiple techniques allow us to report a wide range of vulnerabilities.
When our hackers conduct thorough assessments,
they even determine how
the interaction of security issues can pose more significant risks
to your company.
Our platform gives your team precise details
on all identified vulnerabilities
to facilitate understanding.
And there,
you can assign team members responsible for remediation
whom we offer support channels
to guide them in risk mitigation.

### Appropriate risk scoring and prioritization

Vulnerability remediation should always be based
on an adequate prioritization of risks.
Among tons of reported security issues,
it is necessary to highlight the most relevant ones,
those that could imply the most danger to your company.
That is why we rely not only on scores such as CVSS
but use other metrics and pay attention to the context,
considering, for instance, probabilities of exploitation
and the critical assets that could be affected in cyberattacks.

### Management and tracking of standards compliance

From our platform,
you can also manage compliance
with many international cybersecurity standards and guidelines
such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, ISO/IEC 27001-2 and OWASP.
You can define specific policies or requirements to be met
and constantly monitor that
your development and security teams ensure that
your applications and other technology comply with them.
