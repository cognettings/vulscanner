definition: Fluid Attacks’ Reverse Engineering (RE) is an outside-in process of deconstructing software, performed by our certified, experienced hackers. They employ this technique, which goes from an overview to an in-depth observation, to analyze and obtain knowledge about your applications’ flaws or vulnerabilities. Although they need to use disassemblers, debuggers and decompilers, this complicated process relies mostly on their skills and creativity. It cannot merely be done by automated tools. RE usually starts with static methods to recognize components, functions and other basic information, and finishes with dynamic ones (using techniques like sandboxing and symbolic execution), more oriented towards focused experimentation to confirm/discard software operation hypotheses. All this can help our hackers understand how difficult it is to hack into your applications or systems and then develop more elaborate attacks to report your cybersecurity weaknesses.

### Manual and accurate testing

This technique is highly useful for teams committed to their company’s
security. They have recognized that relying on automated tools for IT
systems’ assessments is not the best option, considering the high rates
of false positives that may be involved.

### What happens inside

RE helps to reveal the innermost details and components of your
applications or systems, as well as their interactions, to recognize
patterns and determine if they pose any cybersecurity risk for your
company.

### An element of comprehensive tests

The RE technique can be complemented by other techniques used in Fluid Attacks,
such as DAST, SAST and SCA,
to constitute a comprehensive application security testing.
This way,
we guarantee minimal rates of false positives and false negatives
in your software's assessments.
