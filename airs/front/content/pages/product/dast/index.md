definition: Fluid Attacks’ Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) detects known and zero-day security vulnerabilities in your applications while they are running. This form of black-box testing (not requiring access to the source code), aims to rapidly find weaknesses in your software that could be exploited by malicious hackers. DAST is a technique with good results detecting flaws related to data, deployment configuration and the business logic of the applications, and it works independently of the language in which the software was developed. All automatic DAST is supported by the manual pentesting work of our experienced red team members who are continuously improving testing technologies and methodologies.

### Simulation of attacks

Through this outside-in technique, we can simulate potential malicious
hackers’ interactions with your applications, observing how the latter
would respond to attacks from the former, in order to detect
vulnerabilities not found through other types of methodologies.

### Testing from early stages

While the DAST technique is applied in many cases on a running
application after production, in DevSecOps, it can be moved to the left
to detect vulnerabilities earlier in internal pre-production
environments, thus saving time and money.

### Minimal rates of false positives

Fluid Attacks’ ethical hackers continuously verify what is automatically
obtained in this technique, and complement the evaluations with manual
DAST to achieve very low rates of false positives.

### Scanning based on standards

Thanks to DAST assessments and reports, and following the necessary
remediation procedures, you will be able to comply with various policies
and regulations (e.g., OWASP, PCI DSS, NIST, HIPAA, CWE, GDPR, CAPEC,
NERC, ISO27K), which you can define as required.

### Low rates of false negatives

A DAST technique performed both automatically and manually allows us to
guarantee low rates of false negatives, contrary to what can be achieved
by companies that depend exclusively on scanning tools.

### An element of comprehensive tests

The DAST technique can be complemented
by other techniques used in Fluid Attacks,
such as SAST, SCA, RE and MPT,
to constitute a comprehensive application security testing.
