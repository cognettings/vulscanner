definition: Fluid Attacks is happy to offer you the widespread Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS) model to address your cybersecurity needs in an ever-changing attack vectors environment. For your convenience, it is supported by our platform. Additionally, it is connected to our Continuous Hacking service in order to go beyond the traditional Penetration Testing, a point-in-time evaluation. In PTaaS, we perform analyses that keep pace with the constant development and changes in your infrastructure and applications. This model provides our customers comprehensive and up-to-date information about the findings achieved in a pentest that combines world-class hackers' know-how and the speed of automated tools. By quickly obtaining extensive details from a non-static report about the detected vulnerabilities, and after carrying out the proper prioritization, you can immediately proceed with their remediation.
