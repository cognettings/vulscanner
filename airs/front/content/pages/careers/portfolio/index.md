The items we expect to see in your portfolio are described below. These
allow you to present your best academic and/or professional
achievements. We also use your portfolio to assess your ability to
express yourself, synthesize ideas, and capture our attention. Your
portfolio is of utmost importance in the selection process.

The objectives of the portfolio are:

- To present examples of a candidate’s ability to achieve concrete and
  outstanding results.

- To demonstrate a candidate’s interest in joining the company.

- To see if the results expected by the company align with the
  demonstrated results of what a candidate can achieve.

Requirements for the portfolio:

1. The portfolio must be delivered in a `PDF` format through the
    application form. In case you experience any trouble, you can also
    submit it via email to <careers@fluidattacks.com>.

2. The portfolio is not a `CV`. Do not use your `CV` as a substitute
    for the portfolio.

3. The portfolio must contain your top `5` achievements, including
    personal, professional and academic achievements. Each one must be
    explained in at most `1` page. Feel free to include:

    - Designs/Diagrams (network, data, class, circuits, etc.).

    - Code examples.

    - Documentation.

4. The portfolio must respect copyrights:

    - Quote relevant sources.

    - For business confidentiality, do not link a specific result to
      the organization it was created for.

    - Reproduce only part of the achievement in order to prevent its
      misuse.

5. The portfolio must follow the guidelines for design portfolios that
    apply to simple engineering assignments:

    - Simple.

    - Interesting.

    - Easy to read.

    - Only your best results.

6. The portfolio must be delivered in a slideshow format, in high
    resolution (aspect ratio `16:9`).

in completing your portfolio will result in the immediate termination
of your participation in the selection process.**
