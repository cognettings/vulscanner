<div class="tc">

If you have questions
about Fluid Attacks products
or the selection process,
please read through the FAQ list.
You might find the answers to your questions here:

</div>

<div class="sect1 b1">

## Before entering

<div class="sect3">

#### 1\. I already applied in a job portal.

<div class="paragraph">

**Why haven't I been invited to the process?**

After you apply to a position listed on any of the portals
we are registered in,
it takes from **one** to **two** days for us
to identify potential candidates,
classify them and send invitations via email.
If you apply and have not received an invitation
or other notification
after two consecutive business days,
and you believe your profile fits the position,
send us an email query at <careers@fluidattacks.com>.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 2\. The test application won't allow me to exit Moodle. What should I do?

<div class="paragraph">

If you already finished the exam,
click the button located on the lower right side of the screen to exit.
If this doesn't work,
try restarting your machine.
Don't worry,
you have already sent the test
and there won't be any data loss.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 3\. I don't know what position I applied for. How can I find out?

<div class="paragraph">

Ask us via email at <careers@fluidattacks.com>.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 4\. If I already applied for a specific position, can I apply again?

<div class="paragraph">

**Using the same application but for different positions?**

Yes.
If it has not been more than six months,
you can send us an email at <careers@fluidattacks.com>
telling us you want to apply for a different position
using your original application.
If it has been more than six months
since your last application
you cannot use your original application;
you must apply again starting at the beginning.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 5\. Can I apply for two different positions at the same time?

<div class="paragraph">

Yes.
You can apply for as many positions as you believe you qualify for;
just send us an email via <careers@fluidattacks.com>
telling us which positions you want to apply for.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 6\. What experience should I already have in order to apply for positions?

<div class="paragraph">

You don't need to have any experience.
What is essential is the ability to do research,
solve issues and be capable of teaching yourself.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 7\. What do I need to know to apply for positions?

<div class="paragraph">

We look for talented people
with great potential and flexibility.
It doesn't matter what your career currently is
or if you haven't graduated yet.
What matters is your ability to adapt
and follow our philosophy and values.
It is preferable if you have experience with programming languages,
but it is not mandatory.
We value your ability to successfully address a problem,
more than your professional degrees.
Our selection process is designed to encourage you
to acquire knowledge yourself
and then use it to problem-solve.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 8\. Does the company offer on-the-job training?

<div class="paragraph">

At Fluid Attacks,
we do not require work experience,
nor do we certify the knowledge you acquire
while working with us.
We do not offer on-the-job training.
It is up to you to acquire the knowledge you may need
and have the ability and the capability
to overcome technical challenges
and successfully complete the immersion stages.
We evaluate all your abilities,
including the attitude,
perseverance and productivity you exhibit
during the selection process
since all of these are necessary for any role in our organization.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 9\. The application test doesn't work. What should I do?

<div class="paragraph">

Try executing the test as an administrator.
If the problem persists,
you should try accessing the test from a different computer.
If you still have problems
send us an email at <careers@fluidattacks.com>.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 10\. I didn't receive the attached file for data analysis. How do I get it?

<div class="paragraph">

Try downloading the file from [here](../non-technical-challenges/hallazgos-open-data.tar.bz2).

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 11\. I ran out of time for the test. Can I get more time?

<div class="paragraph">

If you have a valid reason
(application lockouts, unexpected restarts, connection issues),
send us an email at <careers@fluidattacks.com>
explaining what happened
and we will tell you how to proceed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 12\. I couldn't send my data analysis. What should I do?

<div class="paragraph">

If you believe
you have a valid reason for not meeting the data analysis deadline,
send us an email at <careers@fluidattacks.com>
telling us why you didn't meet it,
and ask for a new delivery date.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 13\. What should I put in my portfolio?

<div class="paragraph">

You can find instructions and advice
for creating your portfolio [here](../portfolio/).

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 14\. What should I do after I've finished the character test?

<div class="paragraph">

Once the character test is completed,
you will receive your test results within minutes.
While you wait,
we suggest you go to the next stage
and begin the knowledge test.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 15\. Do I have to take the polygraph test?

<div class="paragraph">

In most cases,
this test is not mandatory during the selection process.
However,
since our business is information security,
it may be necessary for you to take this test
depending on the position you are applying for.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 16\. Do I have to take the Gallup test?

<div class="paragraph">

This test is only required in certain cases.
Please notify us via email when you reach this stage,
and we will tell you whether or not you need to take it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 17\. Does this process perform a risk analysis with my data?

<div class="paragraph">

Yes,
in the stage before hiring,
confirmation is made on the central risk
concerning any of your candidate data.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 18\. I haven't notified my current employer that I am applying for a job

<div class="paragraph">

**with another company. Is the reverse references stage mandatory?**

Because this is an advanced stage in the selection process,
yes, it is mandatory.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 19\. Is it mandatory to complete all of the stages in the process?

<div class="paragraph">

Not necessarily.
It depends on the position you applied for
and your selection process.
We will tell you how to proceed,
and as always,
if you have any questions,
contact us.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 20\. What does offer validity time mean?

<div class="paragraph">

It is the length of time
Fluid Attacks will hold open a job offer
made to a specific candidate.
If during this time the candidate does not respond
with explicit and written acceptance of the job offer,
the offer will become invalid.
Another candidate will then be offered the job.
This allows us to fill positions as soon as possible.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 21\. If I do not accept the offer, what happens to my immersion process?

<div class="paragraph">

Your immersion process ends immediately.
Fluid Attacks will remove access to all training systems
and notify you of the total work hours
to be put on your monthly time-worked invoice.

## Applied to employees

<div class="sect3">

#### 1\. What are the responsibilities of my job?

<div class="paragraph">

Fluid Attacks strives to be agile and flexible,
capable of adapting to changes at high speed.
To accomplish this goal,
we keep each work team around **50** team members.
In addition,
we require generic roles and a lot of teamwork,
which allows co-workers to augment each other's strengths
and overcome weaknesses.
Because of this,
each profile is grouped in one of these roles:
technical and non-technical.

In technical roles,
responsibilities typically include the following:
hacking systems,
auditing source code,
developing attack exploits,
developing tools for hackers,
documenting found vulnerabilities,
configuring infrastructure as code,
performing peer review,
presenting reports to customers,
sharing knowledge with customers and co-workers,
migrating obsolete information
and creating new information,
among others.

In non-technical roles,
responsibilities typically include the following:
customer management,
technical pre-sales,
marketing, representing Fluid Attacks to other companies,
conference or seminar speakers
and crisis management,
among others.

In short,
the responsibilities defined for each role can be flexible,
and we expect you to contribute ideas and adapt,
depending on the needs of the company.
We truly appreciate high technical skilled employees
who, after fulfilling technical roles,
can gradually migrate to non-technical roles.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 2\. What kind of contract does Fluid Attacks offer?

<div class="paragraph">

At Fluid Attacks,
we offer one type of contract:
A labor contract for an indefinite period
with all the benefits required by law,
as well as other financial contributions to healthcare,
retirement fund,
allowances, layoffs,
all paid on 100% of the salary amount.
All employees have the same type of contract
regardless of their role.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 3\. Does the salary offer coincide to the amount deposited into my account?

<div class="paragraph">

No,
the salary offer corresponds to the gross salary.
The net salary will depend on your personal variables,
such as the amount you want to contribute to retirement funds,
and the number of dependents you declare for tax purposes,
among others.
However,
in the following [link](http://www.elempleo.com/co/calculadora-salarial/)
you can simulate an approximated value for your net salary.
Enter the proposed salary in the first field ("Salario").
Then press "Calcular."
In the monthly net compensation field,
you will find an approximated amount of money
which will be your monthly take-home pay.
This is your approximate net salary
which will be deposited into your account.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 4\. Why is there a difference between the gross salary and the net salary?

<div class="paragraph">

See the answer to the question above.
In addition to the personal variables that you control
which impact your net salary,
there are also salary deductions required by law
which support governmental programs.
These deductions are determined by the government,
and cannot be modified by the employer or the employee.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 5\. As an employee, do I have to pay my own social security deduction?

<div class="paragraph">

No.
Fluid Attacks withholds from your paycheck all deductions
and forwards them to the appropriate agencies
(EPS, retirement funds, compensation funds, etc.).
Your net salary is,
therefore,
the money that is directly deposited into your bank account.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 6\. Do you ever change the salary offer?

<div class="paragraph">

No.
Each salary offer is carefully assessed by a hiring committee
of **three** to **five** Fluid Attacks upper-level managers.
Each offer is based on salaries
for comparable positions within Fluid Attacks
and is aligned with Fluid Attacks employees
at the same performance and productivity level.
Fluid Attacks also takes into consideration
the compensation offered by other companies,
including those in different business sectors,
for comparable positions.
For this reason,
the salary offer you receive represents our best and only offer.
As an employee's productivity,
performance, knowledge and responsibilities increase
opportunities exist to increase their salary as well.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 7\. Does Fluid Attacks have a variable salary?

<div class="paragraph">

No,
we don't.
We believe using a variable salary causes more problems
than it solves.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 8\. What additional benefits do I have as an employee?

<div class="paragraph">

- Prepaid healthcare.
- Forgivable loans for hacking certifications exams.
- Time to study for hacking certifications.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 9\. How does Fluid Attacks support an employee's training and development?

<div class="paragraph">

With time and money:

- **In time:**
  The time you put into training,
  on workdays or weekends,
  can be reported
  and is then subject to compensation.

- **In money:**
  Fluid Attacks pays
  for the professional certification tests you take,
  which enhance your value as an employee.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 10\. Is it mandatory to train for professional certifications?

<div class="paragraph">

No.
It's a professional development option
that Fluid Attacks offers to its employees.
However,
training for and receiving professional certifications
can only enhance an employee's ability
to take on new roles and responsibilities,
as needed,
within Fluid Attacks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 11\. When does my certification time start? Is it negotiable?

<div class="paragraph">

It is not negotiable.
All the certifications sponsored by Fluid Attacks
follow the same funding model.
However,
this model allows certain variations.
For example,
an employee can decide to not pursue a professional certificate
or to pay for the certifications
or the materials themselves,
in which case the funding is not required.
It is also possible to quit
before the **48** months time period
and the funding will then be proportional.
Finally,
any professional certification,
along with the knowledge acquired,
is a skill the employee takes with them
when or if they leave the organization.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 12\. What happens if I do not pass the certification test?

<div class="paragraph">

Nothing happens if you do not pass the certification test
unless you are not willing to keep trying.
While Fluid Attacks values the results of a test,
we also highly value the experience and knowledge you gain
by going through the process;
this is why there is no salary adjustment
when you obtain certification
nor when you fail to obtain it.
Fluid Attacks may sponsor your retests indefinitely,
as long as there is evidence,
as reflected in your training time reports,
of your continued effort to gain certification.
We have people who have taken the same
certification test multiple times,
always with the sponsorship of Fluid Attacks.
Finally,
if you don't pass
and don't want to keep trying to pass,
there would be a monthly salary deduction
during the following **24** months
and in case of your resigning your position,
this amount will be subtracted from the settlement pending balance.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 13\. What is the exact amount of the certification funding?

<div class="paragraph">

The exact value is determined at the time of purchase
because it varies depending on the certification,
the components you want to cover
(test or official material),
price variations on the vendor's side, etc.
For reference purposes,
certifications cost between **USD 300** and **USD 1000**.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 14\. How should I manage my time?

<div class="paragraph">

Every talent should agree with their direct leader
the personal reference schedules of **48** hours per week
from Monday to Friday,
starting at **7 a.m.**.
This reference schedule must intersect **75%** of our customers schedules
(**7 a.m.** to **6 a.m.** COT).
However,
this schedule is a reference,
you must take into account the timing of your duties,
notifying in due time
without asking permissions about the exceptions
on your reference schedule.
This grants you autonomy and freedom without paperwork
when your role and compromises allow it.
There are **zero tolerance** on failures
to comply deadlines or third party meetings
either with customers or coworkers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 15\. Can I adjust my schedule if I'm currently studying?

<div class="paragraph">

Yes,
in the framework of the previous answer.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 16\. How does the time report record my work?

<div class="paragraph">

We use an automated time report system called TimeDoctor.
TimeDoctor tracks activities in real-time,
without any additional input from the employee.
This system logs all the activities performed by an employee
while they are working.
It can also be disabled when an employee is not working
and needs to perform personal activities.
There is no expected total working timeshare.
In exceptional cases,
when an employee exceeds **48** hours per week,
the organization adjusts assignments
and grants compensatory days as soon as possible.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 17\. If the work schedule is 48 hours/week

<div class="paragraph">

**Why doesn't the reported pay reflect 48 hours/week?**

The reference schedule only defines the work availability expectation
for an employee.
We understand that
each person has a different work pace
which may vary from week to week,
for this reason,
expecting a rigid **48-hour** workweek every week is unrealistic.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 18\. Does Fluid Attacks have a dress code?

<div class="paragraph">

It depends on whether you are working at a Fluid Attacks' facility
or onsite at the client's facility:

- When working at a Fluid Attacks facility,
  there is no dress code.
  We suggest you dress comfortably in business casual attire.

- When working at a client's facility,
  we expect you to comply with the client company's dress code.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 19\. Do I have to work on weekends or at night?

<div class="paragraph">

Ordinarily,
Fluid Attacks does not ask you to work nights or weekends,
however,
it may happen from time to time.
In a worst-case scenario,
in a year we may ask you to work **four** weekends and **10** nights.
This does not include situations
where you may have to work weekends or nights
in order to meet a client company's project deadline
or meet your work commitment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 20\. Where will I be working?

<div class="paragraph">

Employees work either at Fluid Attacks facilities
or at our client company's facilities.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 21\. Does Fluid Attacks allow telecommuting?

<div class="paragraph">

See the answer to question 20.
Fluid Attacks does not allow telecommuting.
Work must be done on-site.
However,
exceptions can be made
allowing telecommuting in extreme and extraordinary cases.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 22\. Can I schedule my vacations ahead of time?

<div class="paragraph">

At Fluid Attacks,
you can schedule vacations
even if you haven't yet finished your probationary work period.
Vacations must be requested
with a minimum of **30** calendar days advance notice
and for a minimum of **5** days,
including weekends.
When we receive your vacation request,
it is placed,
along with vacation requests from other employees,
in the order in which we received it.
Therefore,
those who have requested vacation time before you
will also receive vacation time before you.
If you have an exceptional event
that you have to attend,
you don't need to request vacation time,
just notify your supervisor.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 23\. When do I get a salary review?

<div class="paragraph">

Salary reviews are done under **three** possible circumstances.
The first circumstance is the yearly review.
The yearly review is mandatory,
is initiated by Fluid Attacks,
and occurs after an employee has worked for **12** months
with the same salary.
The second circumstance is the extemporaneous review.
Extemporaneous reviews are optional,
are also initiated by Fluid Attacks,
and occur before an employee has worked for **12** months
with the same salary.
The third circumstance is the requested review.
Requested reviews are initiated by,
and at,
the employee's request.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 24\. What are the possible outcomes of a salary review?

<div class="paragraph">

A salary review can result in a determination
that your current salary is appropriate
and hence,
the salary is not changed,
or it may be slightly adjusted
regarding the legal minimum wage of the previous year.
A salary review can also result in re-scaling,
which means your current salary would be adjusted
to a higher scale.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 25\. What factors determine my salary?

<div class="paragraph">

Your salary is determined by 3 factors:
historical performance,
long-term alignment
and group payment capacity.

- Historical performance,
  within the framework of Fluid Attacks' values and processes,
  is represented as a constant value generation.

- Long-term alignment indicates that
  your career goals are completely aligned
  with the needs of our company.
  Therefore,
  your long-term career plan can be fully realized
  through your work with Fluid Attacks.

- Group payment capacity is an external factor
  that defines the ability of Fluid Attacks
  to fulfill commitments on a long-term basis.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 26\. What factors DO NOT determine my salary?

<div class="paragraph">

Your salary is not affected by factors
such as your academic achievement,
professional certifications,
seniority,
work experience inside or outside Fluid Attacks,
professional position within Fluid Attacks' hierarchy,
previous salaries you may have received in different companies,
or your current salary expectations.
(See the question above for the factors that determine salaries.)
This means that
there could be hackers or programmers
with higher salaries than their bosses,
and people with basic education earning more
than people with masters degrees.
Attaining professional certifications does not
necessarily increase your salary.
Salaries are only increased
if historic performance and long-term alignment
are improved as a result of the new certifications,
and therefore,
result in an increase in the employee's knowledge and skills,
and if Fluid Attacks can afford such an increase
in the long term.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 27\. How does Fluid Attacks determine the salary factor for a new employee?

<div class="paragraph">

For a new employee,
who has never worked for Fluid Attacks,
historic performance and long-term alignment is defined
by the new employee's selection process.
This is why the selection process is strict and rigorous.
However,
there can be two possible failures within this system.
One is an underestimation of the new employee's skills,
abilities and knowledge,
in which case we would perform an extemporaneous salary review.
The other is an overestimation of skills,
abilities and knowledge,
which would result only in an inflation adjustment
in a yearly salary review.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 28\. What would be my estimated salary after one year?

<div class="paragraph">

See [question 23](#q23).

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 29\. What are the available salary ranges?

<div class="paragraph">

At Fluid Attacks,
salaries range from $1.4M COP to $14M COP.
These values follow an exponential distribution,
meaning there are more people in the lower salary range
and fewer people in the higher salary range.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 30\. What does Fluid Attacks expect from a new employee?

<div class="paragraph">

At Fluid Attacks,
we have three unchanging,
non-negotiable [values](../../about-us/values):

- **Honesty:**
  We expect new employees to strictly abide by our ethics code,
  to follow our working philosophy,
  to always speak the truth using defined channels
  and in a respectful manner.
  We expect all employees,
  regardless of how long they have worked for Fluid Attacks,
  will exercise maximum security
  in safeguarding our company's and customer's confidential information.
  In addition,
  our expectation is that
  employees will use their hacking knowledge in a responsible manner.
  Do not hack without authorization,
  even outside Fluid Attacks.

- **Teamwork:**
  We expect new employees to help their coworkers,
  whether team-players or team-leaders,
  in tasks the new employee may not like but the work requires.
  We expect new employees
  to work in a dedicated and focused manner
  on all assigned projects.
  We prefer projects to be finished early,
  but not at the expense of sacrificing work quality.

- **Discipline:**
  We expect new employees to self-manage
  without constant supervision,
  to meet all deadlines without excuses,
  to arrive on time for all commitments and meetings
  with customers and coworkers,
  to send deliverables with zero adjustments,
  to work on the issues of the client's company
  with effort and integrity,
  and to actively innovate
  and start to improve our client's company and Fluid Attacks.

Finally,
we expect that all three unchanging,
non-negotiable values
will always be practiced
and that over time will be used effortlessly,
consistently and with effectiveness.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 31\. What are Fluid Attacks' technical expectations from a new employee?

<div class="paragraph">

Our motto says,
**"Find all vulnerabilities and report them as soon as possible."**
To meet this expectation,
a new employee must

- program in innovative and functional ways;

- generate daily value in production deployments;

- search for ways to make things work
  (do not make excuses to avoid doing them);

- hack the customer's systems
  without being detected;

- extract as much information as possible
  from every customer's system
  to help them understand the real impact of a vulnerability;

- document all vulnerabilities immediately after finding them;

- report all existing vulnerabilities;

- notify customers about installed backdoors,
  and uninstall them after finishing the project;

- hack as many systems as possible
  in the assigned time;

- find critical vulnerabilities
  including those that may not be obvious;

- share with and willingly teach coworkers
  any new hacking techniques;

- make meaningful contributions to Fluid Attacks' products;

- focus on your default activity
  when a lockout comes out
  (migration, product, blog posts, etc.).

- search for solutions independently;

- be willing to learn,
  improvise and create when a solution is not easily found.
  Ask for help if you need it,
  but do not simply expect someone else to solve it.

In general,
we look for dedicated persons
who are willing to share their knowledge
and fulfill their roles with no excuses.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 32\. Can I grow professionally at Fluid Attacks?

<div class="paragraph">

At Fluid Attacks,
we classify growth in 3 different areas:
authority, knowledge and money.

Growth in authority is usually low
since we do not intentionally try to grow our workforce
but to have highly competitive products instead.
Therefore,
our managerial positions are open only
when someone leaves a position
or when there are personnel retirements.
Our current CEO started as a support engineer 10 years ago.

Growth in knowledge is high
since we,
not the customer,
control the technologies we use.
We constantly update our tools
because we audit many customers and,
therefore,
we must learn the most current and emergent technologies
within a very short timeframe.
The projects are short
and the learning is constant.
In the security and hacking area,
we have the experience and the track record
to be considered the largest hacking company in Latin America.

Growth in money tends to be in the midrange
because salaries at Fluid Attacks are not only attached
to the growth in authority
(non-technical scale)
but also to the growth in knowledge
(technical scale).
This is why it is common to find engineers
with higher salaries than their bosses
(see [question 23](#q23)).

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 33\. Can my role evolve over time?

<div class="paragraph">

**Can my role evolve
in accordance with my acquired knowledge and certifications?**

Seniority,
certifications and knowledge
do not guarantee the evolution of your role.
An employee may occupy the same role for a long time,
have many certifications,
learn many new technologies,
and still not improve their performance,
or use these factors to improve Fluid Attacks.
For this reason,
none of the previously mentioned variables
can guarantee the evolution of the role.
As an employee,
you can evolve if your performance keeps improving every trimester,
if you follow the defined process,
and if you consistently deliver high-quality results.

</div>

#### 34\. How does Fluid Attacks honor a performance that exceeds the expected?

<div class="paragraph">

Fluid Attacks has a simple philosophy.
If you consistently perform over the expected,
you are rewarded through a salary re-scaling.
The reward is more significant
if it's made within the first **12** months.
The reward is always made in private
and results in a higher standard
for the future performance of the employee,
and hence another re-scaling will be more difficult to obtain.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect3">

#### 35\. If my salary is not re-scaled, am I doing something wrong?

<div class="paragraph">

No.
If in a yearly salary review there is no salary re-scaling,
it means that
the assigned salary corresponds to the historical performance
and long-term alignment of Fluid Attacks,
and is equivalent to our other employees
within the same variable salary range.
The more time an employee spends with Fluid Attacks,
the farther their salary moves
into the salary range of the employees
within that particular salary re-scaling group.
These re-scalings,
in turn,
become less often.
If an employee achieves a higher salary range,
but their performance or long-term alignment is less
than that expected by Fluid Attacks,
a private conversation and an improvement plan will be initiated.
The requirements of the improvement plan must be met
within a stated time-frame
or the employee risks termination of employment.

#### 36\. What is our technology stack?

<div class="paragraph">

All our technology is on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/en/),
using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
for ephemeral and production environments,
as well as for CI/CD agents.
Our infrastructure as code is made through [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/),
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
and [Dockerfile](https://www.docker.com/).
We use [GitLab as a Service](https://about.gitlab.com/)
for these processes' orchestration
(git, docker registry, issues, etc.).
The service backends and attack weapons are developed in [Python](https://www.python.org/),
our frontend is currently in migration to [React](https://reactjs.org/)
under [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
only with stateless components.
The backend is in migration to [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
All the documentation and the web page is built on [AsciiDoc](http://AsciiDoc.org/)
using a static generation strategy via [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).
The operative systems on each workstation
depend on the employee's preferences,
but we have a lot of [Debian](https://www.debian.org/index.es.html)
and security derivated such as [Kali](https://www.kali.org/).
Some renegades use [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)
or [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).
Inside AWS,
we use serverless services like
[Dynamo](https://aws.amazon.com/en/dynamodb/) for databases,
[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/en/s3/) for high speed storage
and [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/en/rds/) for relational databases.
For clusters, we use [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/en/eks/)
to avoid the maintenance of complex cluster components.
We use external services such as [Okta](https://www.okta.com/)
for identity federation,
[Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) for telemetry,
[Rocket Chat](https://rocket.chat/) for chatops,
[Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/flow)
for productivity analytic,
[Mozilla SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) for secrets management,
[Helm](https://helm.sh/) for cluster management,
[Launch Darkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) for feature flags,
[Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp) for web attacks,
[Canvas](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/canvas/)
for infrastructure attacks,
[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-professional)
for preliminary vulnerability analysis,
among others.

#### 37\. What is our development methodology?

<div class="paragraph">

Fluid Attacks documents,
programs and configures infrastructure through source code.
This allows an extensive use of Git,
a rigorous control of the changes
and all rollback advantages.
We follow a trunk-based development as baseline,
having a unique long-term environment
(production)
associated with a unique branch
(master).
There are no other environments or feature branches.
We work under a mono-repo philosophy,
and therefore,
we have relatively few repos.
Each developer has only one branch
(zero inventory)
and developer branches must integrate to the master branch
after a merge request.
This means merge commits are not allowed.
Our history is lineal and,
hence,
a constant rebasing is imperative.
There are no test analysts or quality assurance,
therefore,
the manual tests are performed by the developer
following the established evidence protocol
that must contain every merge request.
The developer is responsible for the automation tests,
whether unit or integration.
Some products already have a test suite
with over **90%** coverage
on their effective lines of code.
Every developer is responsible for their changes
(real DevOps),
for monitoring the technologies through telemetry tools
(chatops)
and to perform rollback,
if necessary.
We use CI/CD tools extensively on each production deployment,
reaching the sum of **5.7 daily deployments**.
Every deployment can be made anytime,
so there are not system maintenance periods,
nor late-night actions associated.
We expect every developer
to deploy at least **one** change per day,
with it being desirable
that they deploy more than **one**.
To this end,
we use the micro-changes philosophy
(production deployments with less than **100** deltas)
in addition to Feature Flags activation if necessary.
The CI runs the linters in **strict** mode
(breaking the build in the presence of the least anomaly),
this allows the applications to be easy to maintain and evolve
because the code is so homogeneous
that it is not known who programmed it.
All the changes must pass through a peer review process
before the integration to the master branch.
This process is made by a coworker
with deep knowledge of the repository
(merger)
and who rejects approximately 30% of the merge requests,
forcing the developer to review
and resend the changes in a new merge request
(transactions over conversations).
Infrastructure is immutable,
therefore,
the containers don't have SSH or RDP management interfaces
for modifications.
This makes root users obsolete,
as well as the associated key management.
All of the above means we do not use Scrum
nor any derivation
since we consider it obsolete
for this ultra-fast development approach.

#### 38\. What is our long-term technological vision?

<div class="paragraph">

Our long-term technological vision is to publish,
on the internet,
all our application and infrastructure repositories.
We believe that
transparency in source code forces us
to comply with the highest security and quality standards.
This helps us convey to the public that
they are capable of auditing and reviewing code themselves,
helps them build confidence in the work done,
and forces us to remove any key or sensitive information
stored in the code,
thus allowing us to disclose the work done by our engineers.
We believe in simple architectures,
even monoliths.
The micro-services based on the size of our organization
represent an architectural over-sizing
instead of a real need.
We believe in functional programming
even in languages that don't require it.
For us,
this reveals more about our conviction
regarding how to code
rather than a philosophical debate about tools.
In this sense,
we prefer static typing over dynamic,
even if it's achieved using additional linters.
The goal is to stick to existing tools
instead of reinventing the wheel.
