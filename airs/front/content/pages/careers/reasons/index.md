Here are **8** reasons why Fluid Attacks is a great place to work:

## Hackers that develop their own tools

When we have projects, we hack applications or corporate networks. When
we do not have projects, we develop our own software tools. This is why
we are looking for hackers that are passionate about programming. Our
favorite technologies are `Linux`, `Git`, `Python`, `Docker`, `Ansible`,
and `Amazon Web Services`. It does not matter if you have not yet
mastered these tools. With Fluid Attacks, what matters is your
capacity to self-teach and learn new skills to address challenges we
face on a daily basis, the discipline with which you face challenges,
the honesty to say what needs to be said, and the ability to listen and
communicate in a manner that fosters respectful and equal collaboration
with other team members.

Do you want to take part in the most challenging selection process there
is? A selection process where no matter the result, you will learn more
than with any other company? If so, then we invite you to participate
and see for yourself that with Fluid Attacks it is better to do then
to know. Our selection process is guided using `Git`, provides feedback
through continuous integration and allows you to improve your world
ranking in programming and hacking, as well as your `GitLab` profile.
You don’t need to have graduated, nor be enrolled in a college or
university, nor have any specific work experience. The only thing that
matters is that you show us you can learn, on your own, at an expected
rate.

## Short projects and high rotations

`70%` of the company’s projects are small (less than `1` month) and
medium (`1` to `6` months). This allows you to constantly become
familiar with new organizations, different problems, different methods,
and to broaden your knowledge.

## Continuous improvement based on International Standards

Fluid Attacks was the first company in Colombia to obtain an
`ISO/IEC 27001` (Information Security) certification at the same time as
we obtained the `ISO 9001` certificate. Also, our continuous improvement
process uses the `ISO/IEC 17025` and Common Criteria standards as a
reference for all security tests.

## Work with industry leaders

Fluid Attacks provides information security services to some of the
biggest organizations in Colombia. This means that there will always be
challenging projects in which you can participate. Our clients include:
Bancolombia, Colpatria, Davivienda, (the biggest banks in the country),
`UNE`, `ETB`, `EDATEL`, Claro (the biggest ISPs in the country) and many
more.

## Great talent working together

Our most valuable asset is our people and we are proud of our amazing
team. In fact, it is a very young team with an average age of `25`. We
believe our talented team makes Fluid Attacks a competitive place to
work and, at the same time, a great place to learn and develop your skills.
The first three `Debian` developers in Colombia work with Fluid Attacks.
Compared to other companies, Fluid Attacks has the highest
percentage of employees certified in

and

[`CompTIA Security+`](../../certifications/#comptia-security+)
and

## Socially responsible

Fluid Attacks also believes that companies, no matter their size or
sector, must contribute to society’s welfare. This is why we, as a
company, support education through the organization “Dividendo por
Colombia” and actively encourage our employees to participate in this
initiative.

## Former employees

We are also proud of our former employees who are now studying or
working in major universities and companies all over the world. Here is

   Sweden, currently `PhD` in Math at the University of Miami.

## Maintaining contact in academia

To us, it is very important to maintain close relationships in academia.
This is why some of our employees teach or have taught courses and
lectures at different universities in Medellin, covering topics such as:

- Information Security

- Secure Development Lifecycle

- Programming

- Networks

- Operating Systems

- Distributed Systems

In addition, we are part of the Business Lecture group at `EAFIT`
University, University of Medellin, La Salle University Corporation, and
the University of Antioquia.

In this program, our employees teach short courses on specific topics,
free of charge, for students at the associated universities. So far, we
have offered courses in Basics of `Linux`, Information Security
Principles, and Hacking through Wargames.
