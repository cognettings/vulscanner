In this stage of the process, we validate the references from your
previous employer. Two of your direct bosses (your boss’s superior and
your family do not apply) from the previous jobs you listed in your
application must call the number provided below.

- Cellphone: **+57 320 788 1879**

This is all about doing everything needed in order to get two of your
former bosses to give us a call in order to have a short conversation
with them regarding your performance so that we can get an idea of how
you worked in their respective companies.

Please send us an email confirming the names and contact information of
the two bosses who are going to call us.

Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any doubts regarding
this step of the application process.

The person who will be answering the calls under the number provided is
Juan Restrepo.
