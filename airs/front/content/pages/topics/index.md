Our blog’s goal is to cover different topics related to security and
other topics of interest in the world of `IT`. Our articles may also
reflect the author’s opinion about a specific issue related to security.
If you want to collaborate with us or submit an article of your own,
check our ideas list below. When we accept an article covering one of
the ideas on our list, we add it to our blog and update the
`#TrendingTopics` list. Among the topics of interest are:
