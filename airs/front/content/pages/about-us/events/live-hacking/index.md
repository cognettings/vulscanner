## 1\. Objective

Have you ever wondered
how safe the applications you use everyday are?
Those that have access to your personal and,
in some cases, financial information?
Are these applications so safe
that the only ones that might be able to compromise them
are the kind of `hackers`
that you see on TV and in movies,
those who sit in front of a black screen
with green letters,
use the keyboard at lightning speed,
and probably speak binary as their second language?

We are sorry to burst your bubble,
but the truth is far from that,
and it probably takes a much less extraordinary person
to compromise your information.
This is usually because the most common vulnerabilities
found in applications
are of the type XSS (Cross Site Scripting),
SQLi (SQL Injections),
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery),
Insecure Session Management and Insecure Configurations,
among others.
These vulnerabilities are widely documented,
and their exploitation can be,
in some cases,
extremely simple,
even without requiring an in-depth knowledge of computation or programming.

We give you a look
at how our ethical hackers exploit these vulnerabilities
to obtain sensitive information,
hijack a session
or even gain root access over the server
running the application.

## 2\. Content

In this conference,
we will use an application named [bWAPP](http://www.itsecgames.com/),
which has the particularity of being vulnerable by design (vbd).
This allows ethical hackers and security enthusiasts
to practice their skills and keep improving,
while those who are just starting in this world can also learn
how to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

The application will be attacked from different levels:
the web interface
and the different services running inside the server.
We start with an identification phase,
followed by the exploitation and privilege escalation.

We will also show the programming issues
that cause these vulnerabilities,
always keeping it simple,
so all participants,
no matter their profession,
can keep up and understand the importance of information security
in a world where applications and devices are multiplying exponentially.

## 3\. Experience

This conference was held in the Information Security Workshop
