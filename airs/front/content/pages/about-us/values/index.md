### How we apply our principles

The following are some examples
of how our values and principles operate
in our business interactions with customers:

  - **We do not keep records of vulnerabilities after projects are closed:**
    No detected vulnerabilities are stored
    for future personal or organizational use.

  - **We only carry out attacks
    with authorization from the client
    and in personal test environments
    or environments created to be hacked
    (CTFs, challenge sites, etc.):**
    Attacks are not carried out as a test,
    outside of work hours
    or outside of the organization to third parties
    (partners, other companies, friends, etc.).

  - **The vulnerabilities we find are confidential:**
    Detected vulnerabilities are only revealed to the client
    and authorized people working directly on the project.
    Hackers do not reveal any information regarding vulnerabilities,
    nor their existence,
    to any unauthorized person inside or outside of Fluid Attacks.

  - **We uninstall any infection
    that we previously installed for an attack:**
    After finishing a client's project,
    all the software installed to infect the system is completely removed.
    If this is not possible,
    the client is notified in writing
    regarding the details of this situation.

  - **We report all detected security issues:**
    If we know a security issue exists,
    we report it in writing to the client.

  - **We assume responsibility:**
    If we at Fluid Attacks discover any errors or missteps on our part
    during work on a client's project,
    we inform the client,
    take full responsibility for any impacts and repercussions,
    and do whatever is required to fix them.

### Ethics

In our company,
the process is every bit as important as the result.
This is why we adhere to the principles described above
and expect the same of everyone involved
in a client's project.

Our business complies with all employer/employee regulations and laws,
such as fair labor practices,
overtime compensation,
equal employment opportunity, etc.,
as mandated by Colombian law.

### Safekeeping information

We permanently monitor and manage the risks
associated with our clients' information.
