# Singer transform module
This module handles all transforms from api objects into singer objects.

# Arch
By design this module is:
- independent of the api module
- agnostic of the etl state objects.

## Exports
- `SingerStreams`: the names of the singer streams that are generated by this module
- `ObjEncoder`: the main interface from which the transform is defined
- `ObjsEncoders`: namespace where all supported `ObjEncoder` are found

## How to implement a new transform?
1. Extend `SingerStreams` for the new obj encoder
1. Create a private module within this module
1. In the private module: implement an `ObjEncoder[_T]`
for the new specific object (`_T`) using the new `SingerStreams` item
1. Expose the new encoder in `ObjsEncoders`

## When to extend this module streams/encoders?
There is only one `SingerStreams` item per object schema, if two streams share
the same schema they are equivalent as so their encoders.
This also implies that objects `_T` and `_R` would be equivalent,
but if this is not the case its better to reuse the equivalent encoder
and then override the stream by another `SingerStreams` item.
