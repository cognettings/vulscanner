    summary: >
      PCI DSS is the global data security standard
      adopted by payment card brands
      for all entities that process,
      store or transmit cardholder data
      and/or sensitive authentication data.
      It consists of several steps
      that mirror security best practices.
      The version used in this section
      is PCI DSS v4.0,
      March 2022.

    summary: >
      FedRAMP is a U.S. Government program
      designed to standardize
      how the Federal Information Security Management Act
      (FISMA) applies to cloud computing services.
      It provides a standardized approach
      to security assessment,
      authorization and continuous monitoring
      of cloud-based services.

      FedRAMP defines a set of security control implementations
      and security impact level systems
      based on NIST baseline controls
      (NIST SP 800-53).

      ISO/IEC 27002 is used as a reference
      for determining and implementing controls
      for information security risk treatment
      in an information security management system (ISMS)
      based on ISO/IEC 27001.
      It describes a suite of information security controls
      to mitigate unacceptable risks to the confidentiality,
      integrity and availability of information.

      Organizations identify and evaluate their own information risks,
      selecting and applying suitable information security controls
      to mitigate unacceptable risks
      using ISO/IEC 27002 for guidance.
      The version used in this section is ISO/IEC 27002:2022.

      The Brazilian General Data Protection Law
      (LGPD) can be considered as Brazil's answer to the GDPR
      —with the Brazilian law
      aligning with the European Regulation in many ways,
      while differing in others.
      The LGPD aims at creating a new legal framework
      for the use of personal data in Brazil,
      both online and offline,
      in the private and public sectors.

      The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)
      provides a methodology for the accurate characterization
      of operational security (OpSec)
      through examination and correlation of test results
      in a consistent way.
      It is one of the most complete
      and commonly used professional standards
      in security audits
      to review the security of systems
      from the internet.
      The version used in this section is OSSTMM 3.0,
