In the course of the penetration testing done by our hackers
in the Squad Plan,
there may be occasions
where you notice an open vulnerability
that was not reported by them;
this would be a **false negative**.
When this happens,
to handle this incident with the utmost care,
both parties must follow the following protocol.

1. The client reports the incident
  over any of the available communication channels.
1. The project manager suspends the billing
  and any pending charges
  with the administrative area.
1. `Fluid Attacks` appoints a two-hour meeting with the client
  in less than eight office hours.
    - The account manager
      and an ethical hacker
      will attend the meeting.
    - `Fluid Attacks` will proceed to analize
      and understand
      the client's report.
    - If possible,
      `Fluid Attacks` will try to replicate the issue in the environments.
1. `Fluid Attacks` schedules a weekly meeting about the postmortem status.
    - The meetings will be scheduled for 11:55 AM (GMT-5)
      and will last 10 minutes.
    - The first meeting will be seven days after the initial two-hour meeting.
    - The meetings will be recurring with no specified end date.
    - From the client's side,
      at least the reporter of the incident
      and their two immediate superiors
      will attend the meetings.
    - From `Fluid Attacks'` side,
      at least the account manager
      and their two immediate superiors
      will attend the meetings.
    - The meeting will be led
      by `Fluid Attacks'` account manager.
    - The agenda for the day would be
      pending postmortem of both parties
      and report dates.
1. `Fluid Attacks` gives the client
  the [potential leak form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p2q6xR0D8x8RgQAZRVgHTSU9-AxgMOqxVkyO6aBbk1M).
1. The client fills
  the potential leak form.
