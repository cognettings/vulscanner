## Description

**99%** of the time,
the Fluid Attacks' platform will be available via the internet
for its registered users.

## Criteria

Besides the [general measurement aspects](/plans/sla/accuracy#details),
this SLA is measured
taking into account the following:

- The reference schedule for the availability
  is 24 hours a day,
  seven days a week.
- For partial availability failures
  (only for one functionality),
  the measurement will be based on the affected office hours
  and adjusted according to the percentage of affected users.
