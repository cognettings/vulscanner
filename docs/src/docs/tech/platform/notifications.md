The following are the kinds
of notifications we send
from the platform.

## Types of notifications

vulnerability is assigned to you,
informing you of its location and
the group where it was reported.
At the end of the message,
you will see a button that says
**Go to type of vulnerability**.
When you click on it,
you will be directed to that
type of vulnerability on the platform.
