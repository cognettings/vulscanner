In the Portfolio section,
you can see the classification of graphs,
tables,
and metrics that only are in this section of
analytics that we have in the platform,
meaning that these metrics are not found
in any other section.
The following are the Portfolio analytics:

## Remediation rate benchmark

![Remediation rate benchmark](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1646411325/docs/web/analytics/portfolios/remediation_rate_benchmarking.png)

This section shows the
percentages of closed,
accepted and open vulnerabilities,
and how your numbers are
compared to the average
and the worst portfolios
of all organizations.

## Distribution of vulnerabilities by group

![Distribution of vulnerabilities](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1666196319/docs/web/analytics/portfolios/distribution_port.png)

The percentage of
closed, open, temporarily accepted
and permanently accepted vulnerabilities
categorized by group.

![Unsolved events by group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1646409172/docs/web/analytics/portfolios/unsolved_events_by_groups.png)

Unsolved [events](/tech/platform/groups/events)
refer to situations that
arise within a group that
prevent our experts from
pentesting part of the scope
—or maybe all of it— and have
not been solved yet.
The above chart shows you how
many of these are in each of
your groups.

## Vulnerability types by group

categorized by group.

## Oldest vulnerability types

These graph shows
the vulnerabilities
that have been open
for the highest
amount of days.

## Vulnerabilities by group

![Vulns By Group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1623443233/docs/web/analytics/portfolios/vulns_by_group_atarhk.png)

The percentage of time that
each group of your portfolio
has unsolved events compared to
the total existence of the group.

## Days since groups are failing

![Days since groups are failing](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1658250049/docs/web/analytics/portfolios/portfolio_oldest_event.png)

This chart shows the number
of days of the oldest
unsolved event in the groups
of your portfolio.
