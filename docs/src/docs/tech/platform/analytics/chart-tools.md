The charts in the Analytics sections
have various tools to help you better
understand the information,
download it or modify its presentation.
These are the chart options:

![Chart Analytics Tools](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1662071077/docs/web/analytics/chart/chart_tools.png)

To activate them,
you have to put the cursor of your mouse on the graphic.

## Filter

This option allows you to
select one variable (e.g.,
amount of time; target of
evaluation) based on which
you would like to limit the
information you see in the chart.
Not all charts have this button.

## Information

This option allows you to go
directly to the section of
[Fluid Attacks Documentation](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/)
where you find information
corresponding to the chart.

## .CSV Download

This option lets
you download graph,
table,
or metric information
as a `.csv` file extension.

## Download

This option allows you to
download the chart as a
`.html` file.

## Refresh

This option allows you to
reload the chart when,
for some reason,
it is not possible to view
its data.
It also allows you to return
to the default view,
clearing any filters you
had applied by clicking
on a color label.

## Expand

This option allows you to
view the chart in a larger
size in a pop-up window.
