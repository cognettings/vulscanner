In the Organization section,
you can see the classification of graphs,
tables,
and metrics that only are in this section of
analytics that we have in the platform,
meaning that these metrics are not found
in any other section.
The following are the Organization analytics:

## Remediation rate benchmark

![Remediation rate benchmark](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1643925701/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_remediation_benchmarking.png)

How do your numbers compare to those of
other organizations? How close are you
to being the best?
Based on our 20 years of experience,
we can benchmark how your organization
is doing in terms of vulnerability
remediation as compared to
other organizations.
This chart shows the
percentages of closed,
accepted and open risk exposure
in your organization,
as well as these percentages in
the best and the worst organization
and the average across all organizations.

## Distribution of vulnerabilities by group

![How Many Vulnerabilities Remediated Accepted](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1666129428/docs/web/analytics/organizations/distribution_of_vulnerabilities_by_group.png)

The percentage of closed, open,
temporarily accepted and permanently
accepted vulnerabilities categorized
by group.

## Open vulnerabilities by group

![Open Vulnerabilities By Group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1645807634/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_open_vuln_by_group.png)

The percentage of open vulnerabilities
that each group has compared with
the whole organization.

## Undefined treatment by group

![Undefined Treatment by Group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1645807634/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_treatmentless_by_group.png)

The percentage of vulnerabilities
with no treatment that each group
has compared with the whole organization.

## Exposure by group

![Exposure by Group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1643925877/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_severity_groups.png)

For each of your groups, you can find out
the exposure (CVSSF) of open vulnerabilities.

## Open vulnerability types by group

![Open vulnerability types by group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1647440139/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_open_types_vuln_by_group.png)

Number of open vulnerabilities
categorized by group.

## Unsolved events by group

![Unsolved events by group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1646408695/docs/web/analytics/organizations/org_unsolved_events_groups.png)

Unsolved [events](/tech/platform/groups/events)
refer to situations that arise
within a group that prevent our
experts from pentesting part of
the scope —or maybe all of it—
and have not been solved yet.
The above chart shows you how
many of these are in each of
your groups.

## Vulnerability types by group

![Vulnerability types by group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1647440139/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_types_vuln_by_group.png)

Number of vulnerabilities
categorized by group.

## Oldest vulnerability types

![Oldest vulnerability types](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1645807634/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_top_oldest_finding.png)

These graph shows the vulnerabilities
that have been open for the
highest amount of days.

## Vulnerabilities by group

![Vulnerabilities By Group](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1645807634/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_vuln_by_group.png)

The percentage of vulnerabilities
that each group has compared with
the whole organization.

## Overall availability of groups

![Availability of groups](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1666187102/docs/web/analytics/organizations/overall_availability_of_groups.png)

The percentage of time that
each group in your organization
has unsolved events compared to
the total existence of the group.

## Days since groups are failing

![Days since groups are failing](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1658250090/docs/web/analytics/organizations/organization_oldest_event.png)

This chart shows the number
of days of the oldest
unsolved event in the groups
of your organization.

## Tags by groups

![Tags By Groups](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1623443232/docs/web/analytics/organizations/tags_by_groups_jebb7a.png)

Here you can see
all the tags you have
and the amount of each one
that belong to each group
of your organization.
