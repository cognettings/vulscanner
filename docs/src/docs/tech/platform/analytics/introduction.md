plenty of information
about the status
of all the [groups](/tech/platform/groups/introduction)
of your [organization](/tech/platform/organization/introduction),
one of the best ways
to look at the general status
of your organization
is by checking the **Analytics** tab.
Here the platform will show you
graphs and numbers
that resume all the information
about your groups for you.
The information you are shown
depends of the section
from where you accessed
the analytics tab,
which are the following:

- From your [**Organization**](/tech/platform/analytics/organization) screen,
  which is the page you land in
  when you log into your account.
  The analytics presented here
  will be about all the groups
  in your organization.
