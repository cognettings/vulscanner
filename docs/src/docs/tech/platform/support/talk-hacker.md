We recognize that sometimes you need
guidance on our platform operations or one of
our services.
That is why we have the **Talk to Hacker**
option on our platform (only available on
[Squad Plan](/tech/platform/support/talk-hacker)).
This function allows you to schedule a
videoconference where you can present the
matters on which you need help.
In this way, we facilitate our communication
and can respond to you as quickly as possible.

1. To find this option,
  you must enter your interest group with
  the **squad plan** and click on the help
  button in the top-right corner of the
  screen or the button located in the
  bottom corner that says **Talk to a Hacker**.

  calendar availability and schedule a
  videoconference according to your
  convenience to meet your information needs.

  time, you need to enter some details
  to make the appointment.
  In addition, you can add guests: people
  from your team that you want to
  join the call.
  Then, you click on the blue
  **Schedule event** button.

1. After that, you can see the
  pop-up window that gives you the
  information about the appointment,
  including the name of the expert
  you will talk to.

1. Finally, you receive an email with
  an invitation to the appointment,
  which is included in your Google Calendar.

Our priority is to serve your
communication requests in the
best possible way.
We hope this option will be
of great benefit to you.
