On [Fluid Attacks' platform,](/tech/platform/introduction)
there are sections
where you can talk directly to us
and communicate all the questions,
requests,
suggestions
and matters
concerning your
[group](/tech/platform/groups/introduction)
or a specific
[vulnerability](/tech/platform/groups/vulnerabilities)
or
[event](/tech/platform/groups/events)
that require much more direct interaction.

There are three locations
where you can post comments
about specific situations for us to help you.

## Concerning groups

On the main page of any group,
click on the tab called **Consulting**.
This section has a text field
where you can add comments about any issues
or questions
that you may have about the group in general.

## Concerning vulnerabilities

You can find a **Consulting** tab
inside all of the different types of
vulnerabilities reported in your group.
When you click on a type of vulnerability,
you can find the tab
on the right-hand side of your screen.

![Vulnerability Consulting](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675169954/docs/squad/consulting/consulting_location.png)

This section should be used to communicate with us
when there are any issues concerning any of the vulnerabilities
reported in that category
or if you have questions about that type of vulnerability in general.
Furthermore,
in this section
you will find comments referencing your requests for [reattacks](/tech/platform/reattacks)
and the results of those reattacks.

> **Note:** Consulting in the vulnerability view is available
> for users with **Plan Machine** in view mode.

## Concerning events

Finally,
you can find a **Consulting** tab
after clicking on any event listed
in the
[Events](/tech/platform/groups/events)
tab of each group.
When you click on the former,
a text field will be available
where you can add your comments.

![Event Consulting](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675187762/docs/squad/consulting/consulting_view.png)

This tab is useful
for when you want to ask us
specific details of the event
and when you consider
that the event has been solved
and wish to notify us about this.

### Notifications

Whenever you post a comment,
you and everyone who has
access to the group where
you posted it and has this
notification enabled will
receive a
[Consulting notification](/tech/platform/notifications#consulting-digest-notification)
via email.
The message will show the comment,
who made it and where.
You can turn on/off these notifications in the
[Notifications section](/tech/platform/notifications).
