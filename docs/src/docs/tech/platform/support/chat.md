![Help Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1674762369/docs/web/support/help_button.png)

In this section,
you will find information on how to use the Live Chat tool.

Remember if you have a question about any
feature of Fluid Attacks' platform or need help
on how to use it, we recommend
you to get in touch using the
**Instant Live Chat** option.
Through this means, we provide you
with fast and personalized support
on minor issues for which it is not
necessary to schedule a video call
(in this case, the
[Talk to Hacker](/tech/platform/support/talk-hacker)
option would apply).

![Liva Chat](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1674764206/docs/web/support/livechat.png)

After you click on Live Chat,
a chat box will appear in the
right corner of your screen,
and you will be enabled to chat
with our Customer Support team.

You need to keep in mind
that the **Instant Live Chat**
service is available from
8:00 AM until 6:00 PM (GMT-5).
Outside these hours,
the chat boxâ€™s title bar will
say **Leave us a message**.
You will be asked
for your email address,
the applicable product and
the kind of help you need.
You may then type your
message and send it.
Since email communication is
much slower than chatting,
we recommend that you provide
us with as much details as you
can about the problem you are having.
Our Customer Support will reply
to your message via email as
soon as possible.
