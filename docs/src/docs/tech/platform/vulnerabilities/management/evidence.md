The **Evidence** tab corresponds
to a subsection where we provide
you with supporting proof of the
existence and exploitation of
the corresponding
[type of vulnerability.](/criteria/vulnerabilities/)
We present such evidence in pictures,
with **.png** and **.jpg** extension and
videos with **WebM** extension
helping us to understand to identify
this type of vulnerability for
the first time in your system.
This evidence changes each time
we perform a
[reattack](/tech/platform/reattacks/) on this
type of vulnerability.
