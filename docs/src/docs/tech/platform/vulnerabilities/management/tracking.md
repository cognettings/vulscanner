Knowing what happened with each
vulnerability is quite important.
So,
it is essential for your team to
obtain information such as dates,
users and justifications for each
change in the history of your
security vulnerabilities.
For this purpose,
thereâ€™s the **Tracking tab** in Fluid Attacks' platform.
This tab gives you detailed information
about each
[vulnerability](/tech/platform/vulnerabilities/management/locations)
in your
software and the
[treatment](/tech/platform/vulnerabilities/management/treatments)
each has
received over time.

You can find the **Tracking tab** in
two different places.
One is in each specific vulnerability type
where you can have a global overview.

The second Tracking tab can be accessed
by first clicking on the
[Locations tab](/tech/platform/vulnerabilities/management/locations)
in a vulnerability type and then clicking
on a specific location where the
vulnerability was found.
There you can find the tab,
which will show you individual details
on the file you chose.

The information
that can be seen here
will be divided in cycles
based on the date of the change
and the type of change that occurred.
Here you will be able
to visualize the amount of vulnerabilities
that were Vulnerable/Safe in a specific date
and also the treatment
that a set amount of vulnerabilities
were given in a specific date,
mentioning its justification
and assigned user.
