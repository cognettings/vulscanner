All the information included there,
which varies from case to case,
we consider to be sensitive and
relevant to your organization.
You might see financial
information (e.g.,
account numbers,
financial movements,
credit card numbers),
personal information (e.g.,
phone numbers,
contacts,
personal IDs,
physical addresses),
technical information (e.g.,
roles,
keys,
access tokens),
among others.
