To assign a vulnerability,
first you need to go to the
[Vulnerabilities](/tech/platform/groups/vulnerabilities)
section and select the type of
vulnerability you want to treat.

Selecting this will take you to the
[location](/tech/platform/vulnerabilities/management/locations/)
view where you can perform actions such as:
Assign vulnerabilities and apply
[treatments](/tech/platform/vulnerabilities/management/treatments)
to them.

![Vulnerability type](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675202064/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/locations_vul_asigne.png)

You can assign vulnerabilities
in **Untreated** status or reassign
vulnerabilities in **Progress** status.
Also,
you can assign a person even if
you have previously applied
the two treatments:
**Temporarily accepted** and
**Permanently accepted**.

In a untreated vulnerability,
to assign it to someone,
you must click on the specific
location of the vulnerability.
After that,
a pop-up window will immediately appear,
showing you three tabs,
from which you need to select
the one called **Treatments**.
After that,
you must change de **Untreated**
to **in progress** status
in the treatment field.

Several fields will be activated here.
You must fill in all them
with the requested information.
In **Assigned**,
you add the email address of the
developer or team member who will
be in charge of fixing the
vulnerability.
After you provide all the
required information,
you must click the **Confirm button**.

> **Note:**
> Only a Fluid Attacks staff member
> can assign a vulnerability to other
> Fluid member. In either case,
> the **Assigned** dropdown list will
> show only valid options for the
> assignment.

Right away,
the new person responsible for
fixing the vulnerability will
receive an email notification
telling them about the new assignment,
specifying the type of vulnerability,
the group and the location.
Clicking the **Go to type of vulnerability**
button will redirect them to
the Location section on Fluid Attacks' platform.

Now,
if you want to change the responsible
for a vulnerability,
it is possible.
In the Assigned field,
you have to put the email of the
new responsible;
this person will receive the
notification New Vulnerability
Assignment.

The person who was assigned the
task will be able to find the
aforementioned
[To do](/tech/platform/vulnerabilities/management/to-do)
function on the top-right
menu of the platform,
next to the megaphone icon.
The number over the icon will
tell them how many vulnerabilities
are assigned to them.
Clicking on the icon will
allow them to see the vulnerability
locations they are responsible
for remediating.
