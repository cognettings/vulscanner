Through this function, you can be
aware of all the vulnerabilities
assigned to you and have good
tracking in your daily tasks.

How can we assign vulnerabilities
to our team?
Enter this [link](/tech/platform/vulnerabilities/management/vulnerability-assignment),
and you will see how to do it!

## To do table

The To do table shows
us what vulnerabilities
are assigned to me,
and I am responsible
for solving them.
You find the following information:

action in the
[locations](/tech/platform/vulnerabilities/management/locations)
view and in the
[To do](/tech/platform/vulnerabilities/management/to-do).
Remember that a reattack is
when you have already applied
a solution for an existing
vulnerability and you want
to validate its effectiveness.

To perform a reattack
from the To do view,
you have to select which
vulnerability you want
to validate by clicking
on the check box on the left,
followed by the **Reattack button**.

![Reattack ToDoList](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675159057/docs/web/vulnerabilities/management/reattack.png)
