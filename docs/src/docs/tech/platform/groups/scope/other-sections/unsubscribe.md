There may be cases
when you want to
remove your user
from a particular group,
making it inaccessible for you
and deleting it from
your list of groups.
In order to do this,
first you need to go
to the **Scope** section
of the group you want to manage.

When you scroll all the way down,
above the **Delete this group** section
you can find the **Unsubscribe** section.

![Unsubscribe Button](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1668544859/docs/web/groups/unsubscribe/unsubscribe.png)

This function is used only to remove
your own user from the group
and thus will not affect anything
related to the group
and its data at all.
It will only remove this group
from the list of groups available to you,
and consequently,
revoke your access to it completely.

![Unsubscribe Modal](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1668544930/docs/web/groups/unsubscribe/unsubscribe_action.png)

By clicking on **Unsubscribe**
a window will appear
in which you will need to type the name
of the group you are currently managing
and click on **Confirm**.
Consider carefully when proceeding
as this action will remove you from this group,
and in case you do not have
any more groups besides this one,
you will be removed from Integrates entirely.

> **Note:** This action will unsubscribe you from the group.
> If you do not have more groups,
> you will be removed from Fluid Attacks' platform.
