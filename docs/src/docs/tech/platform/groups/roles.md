Users on Fluid Attacks' platform have different
roles with associated permissions
relevant to work on the platform.

the most privileges,
this user can do everything
that a client is allowed to do

the leaders of the product
and, besides the basic privileges,
it allows the user to generate reports,
define important treatments like
accepting vulnerabilities permanently,
requesting Zero Risk treatments,
adding and editing users for the group
and more.

## User role

This is the default user role,
