Sometimes,
a situation may arise in a
[group](/tech/platform/groups/group-view)
that prevents our analysts
from pentesting part of the
[scope](/tech/platform/groups/scope)
or maybe all of it.
Your team needs to keep track
of these situations and solve them,
so we can resume our assessments.
The place on the [platform](/tech/platform/introduction)
where you can see a cumulative record of
solved and unsolved events in
your group is the Events section.

![Event Tab View](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675168760/docs/web/groups/events/events_tab.png)

## Events Table

This section shows a table
providing the following
information:

![Event Table](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1683814732/docs/web/groups/events/event_table.png)

- **ID:**
  The eventâ€™s unique identifier.
- **Root:**
  Refers to the
  nickname of the [root.](/tech/platform/groups/scope/roots#git-roots)
- **Date reported:**
  When the event was reported.
- **Description:**
  The problem that,
  according to the
  hacker,
  impeded,
  or still impedes,
  their security assessments.
- **Type:**
  The category in which
  the problem falls,
  which can be Authorization
  for special attack,
  Incorrect or missing supplies,
  ToE different from what
  was agreed upon or Other.
  You can enter [here](/tech/platform/groups/events#types-of-events)
  if you want to know more about
  the different types of events.
- **Status:**
  The condition of the event,
  which can be Solved,
  Pending, or Unsolved.
  You can enter
  [here](/tech/platform/groups/events/#status-in-the-event)
  if you want to know more.
- **Date closed:**
  When the event was solved,
  if it was;
  otherwise,
  only a hyphen is shown.

## Status in the event

The statuses help us to have more
clarity about the status of our events.
We handle three types:
**Unsolved,**
**Pending,**
and **Solved.**
Here we will explain
the flow of these.

First,
when an event is opened,
it will have the status **Unsolved**.

![Unsolved Status](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675168878/docs/web/groups/events/unsolved_status.png)

Here you have to give the
solution to this created event.
When you have it,
go to the checkbox on the
left and click on it.
When you do this,
the **Request Verification** option
will be activated immediately.

![Request Verification Option](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675168988/docs/web/groups/events/request_verification.png)

When you click on it,
you will get a pop-up window
where you will have to explain
the justification of how
you solved this event;
remember to enter at least ten characters,
followed by clicking on the **Confirm button**.

![Confirm Button](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1661276494/docs/web/groups/events/status_confirmb.png)

At this moment,
our event will enter
the **Pending state**,
where we will be waiting
for the verification that
the supplied solution is effective.

![Pending State](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675169227/docs/web/groups/events/pending.png)

When validated and the
solution successful,
it will move to our third **Solved state**.

If this solution does not work,
the event will be set to
**Unsolved status**,
and you will receive a
notification where you will see
a comment from the analyst.
These comments will be sent
to you as a
[notification](/tech/platform/notifications/#consulting-digest-notification),
but you can also see them in the
[Consulting](/tech/platform/groups/events#consulting) tab.
