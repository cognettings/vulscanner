When we talk about authors on our [platform](/tech/platform/introduction)
we refer to all **developers**
or **professionals** who have
contributed to the
repositories of the [groups](/tech/platform/groups/introduction)
under evaluation.
You can access the
**Authors** section when you
enter one of your groups.

![Authors Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675108456/docs/web/groups/authors/authors_table.png)

## Authors table

The Authors table shows us who has
contributed to the project or group.
It is composed of five columns.

![Authors table](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1682707715/docs/web/groups/authors/authors_columns.png)

- **Author:**
  The author name and the email
  registered in the platform.
- **Groups Contributed:**
  Name of the group to which the
  author contributes.
- **Commit:**
  The first author commit of the month.
- **Repository:**
  The first repository that was
  detected in the month.
- **Registration status:**
  This column shows which authors are not
  yet registered in the platform,
  and their registration status,
  which can be:
  Registered,
  pending,
  or invite.

## Functionalities

In this section of the **platform**
we find the following functionalities:

- [Filter per month](/tech/platform/groups/authors#filter-per-month)
- [Filters](/tech/platform/groups/authors#filters)
- [Export](/tech/platform/groups/authors#export)
- [Search bar](/tech/platform/groups/authors#search-bar)

### Filter per month

When you need to see the list
of authors for a specific month,
simply click on the date at the
top left to drop down a menu
with all the months of work
in that group.

![Authors Specific Month](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1665672041/docs/web/groups/authors/filter_date.png)

### Filters

By clicking the **Filters** button,
which you can find on the
upper left-hand side,
you have three filters enabled to
apply to your listing:
**Author**,
**Groups Contributed** and
**Repository**.

### Export

You can download the list of
authors as a CSV (comma-separated
values) file by clicking on
the **Export** button.

### Search bar

The search bar filters the information
contained in the columns of the table.

## Invite authors

The notion of shared responsibility for secure development
makes it especially important that
all of the contributors to any given repository
be part of our [platform](/tech/platform/introduction).
If you are a [user manager](/tech/platform/groups/roles#user-manager-role),
you can send registration invitations to contributors
who do not have accounts on our platform yet
by clicking the **Invite** button.

![Authors Tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675116938/docs/web/groups/authors/invite_authors.png)

The platform will [email](/tech/platform/notifications#access-granted)
the author showing them two possible options:
Confirm access and Reject access.
During the time it takes the
author to respond to the
registration invitation,
you will see the Registration status
column showing a Pending status
for the author in question.

![Authors Section](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1675117042/docs/web/groups/authors/pending_status.png)

If the author rejects
the invitation,
the status will revert
to Invite,
whereas if the author
accepts the invitation,
the status will become
Registered.
