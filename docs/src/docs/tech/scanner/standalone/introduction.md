## Why

Ever needed to

- execute static checks locally
    to make sure your code is secure
    and complies with most of
    the current security rules;
- execute dynamic checks
    on your endpoints or cloud environments;
- find possible breaches
    and know the exact location
    of each vulnerability;
- do all of the above
    and more with a free tool.

Well, we have!

## What

Machine Standalone is a CLI application
that can be configured to analyze source code, web services,
among others other attack surfaces,
and produces detailed reports
with the security vulnerabilities found.
