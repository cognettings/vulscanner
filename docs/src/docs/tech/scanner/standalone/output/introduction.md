Depending on the format,
Machine Standalone will inform you
of different things.

For personal use,
we recommend using the CSV format
or the CLI snippets because
it contains more meaningful information
when it comes to understanding
and evaluating the risk in
your source code or endpoint.

On the other hand,
the SARIF format contains a lot
of information that is not
very informative for the end-user.
This format is used,
among other things,
for internal processes within the organization,
and for that reason,
that output will not be explained.
At least not for now.

The meaning of each
field that Machine Standalone
returns will be explained in the following pages.
