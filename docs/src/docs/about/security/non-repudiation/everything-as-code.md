At `Fluid Attacks`,
we try to keep as much material as possible
versioned in a Git repository.
By doing so,
we can have comprehensive logs of exactly

- what was changed;

- who changed it;

- when it was changed, and

- who approved the change.

Currently,
we keep all our systems as code:

- [Platform](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/commits/trunk)

- [Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/)

- [Infrastructure](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/about/security/integrity/developing-integrity#infrastructure-as-code-iac)

- General documentation

## Requirements

- [075. Record exceptional events in logs](/criteria/requirements/075)
- [079. Record exact occurrence time of events](/criteria/requirements/079)
- [378. Use of log management system](/criteria/requirements/378)
