Every project has a pseudonym
within our systems,
which brings advantages
such as the following:

- Employees without direct access to the project
  do not know the client's name
  or any other information that can help them
  [connect the project with the client](/criteria/requirements/313).

- Internal analytics charts
  and other documents
  never use the client's name;
  they use the project's pseudonym.

Generally speaking,
only the people who need to know
who the client of a project is
are those who actually know it.

## Requirements

- [300. Mask sensitive data](/criteria/requirements/300)
- [313. Inform inability to identify users](/criteria/requirements/313)
