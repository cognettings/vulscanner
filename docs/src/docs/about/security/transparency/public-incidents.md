In an effort to be transparent
and keep stakeholders informed,
we report all news and incidents
on our [News site](https://news.fluidattacks.tech/?label=15603).

Each report contains the following items:

- **What happened**
- **What we have done**
- **What the impact was**
- **What we are doing to help**

The incidents are informed through the [help channel](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/about/security/transparency/help-channel/)
to keep track of each case individually.
