In order to have a direct communication channel with our clients
and reply to any doubts they may have,
we have an email ticket system (help@fluidattacks.com).
We treat tickets as confidential information,
and only support engineers within `Fluid Attacks` can see them.

Anyone can send us a concern or request,
and our engineers will contact them
within the next 24 hours.
