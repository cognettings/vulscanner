In cases where `Fluid Attacks` detects a breach,
we send emails to notify the involved parties.
These emails contain information about

- what data was leaked or compromised;
- when the data was leaked or compromised, and
- how long the data was leaked or compromised
  (to the extent this information is available).

For a breach that exposes the private data of many users,
we take care to inform the public
via email.

## Requirements

- [313. Inform inability to identify users](/criteria/requirements/313)
