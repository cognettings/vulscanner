The source code of all our applications is available
on the Internet.
The security advantages
of having open-source code
are the following:

- **Auditability:** Anyone on the Internet can audit public code.
  This means that to keep our business secure,
  we must be careful
  about the quality of the source code we publish.
  This is why we avoid common bad practices
  such as backdoors,
  exposed secrets
  and the use of vulnerable dependencies.

- **Transparency:** The complete history of our source code
  can be found
  [here](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/commits/trunk).
  By publishing it,
  we let interested parties know exactly
  what we are fixing,
  improving or adding to our software.
