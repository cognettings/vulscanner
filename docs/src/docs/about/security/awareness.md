## Description

The idea of this program
is to keep our team members aware
of the most common cyber risks,
and the actions that can be taken
to protect all type of data.

As part of the awareness program,
Fluid Attacks has selected
some online learning resources
that cover topics like data security,
social engineering and privacy in general.
These concepts are aligned
with well-known standards and frameworks
inside the cybersecurity field.

This training is primarily taken
by all the **administrative talent**
in order to keep updated in concepts
related to our company's activities.
They need to complete
the course, then get and present
the certificate of completion.

## Resources

These resources are analyzed
periodically (once per year)
to evaluate the pertinence
of their content.
