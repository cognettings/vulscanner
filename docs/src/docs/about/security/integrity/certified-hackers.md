We continuously encourage our hackers
to certify their knowledge.
Usually,
hackers start applying for certificates
after having worked in the company
for six months.

[Here](https://fluidattacks.com/about-us/certifications/)
you can find a comprehensive list of certifications
that our team of hackers currently holds.
