All job applicants must undergo an extensive
[testing process](https://fluidattacks.com/careers)
to prove their technical capabilities
and human values.

The technical part of the testing process
involves solving programming and hacking challenges,
uploading them to a Git repository
with highly strict linters and compilers,
and ascending in an
[organizational ranking](https://app.autonomicjump.com/).

The human values section of the testing process
includes creating a portfolio
with the five most important achievements of the candidate,
going to the office during a training phase
to work alongside the team,
job interviews,
among other things.
