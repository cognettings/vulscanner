As data is likely our most valuable asset,
we have strong backup policies for everything,
for example:

- Our redundant data centers are fully versioned,
  meaning that any file can be recovered
  or returned to a previous version.

- As all our backups are stored
  in decentralized data centers,
  problems like hard drive lifespans
  are not a concern.
  The backups exist seamlessly
  for as long as we want,
  giving us full traceability
  and recoverability.

- [Our platform's](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
  database has daily, weekly, quarterly
  and annual full backup schedules.
  The daily backups last one week,
  the weekly ones twelve weeks,
  the quarterly ones three years,
  and the annual ones fifteen years.

- Our platform's database has point-in-time recovery
  with the ability to recover the database
  to the state it was in at a specific date and time
  (hours, minutes and seconds)
  over the last 35 days.

- All the exploits are versioned.
