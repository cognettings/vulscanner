[As cloud provider](/development/stack/aws)
we benefit of
[AWS global infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)
using multiple zones
to ensure high availability
of our systems.

Used zones are:

- Primary: EE.UU. East Region
  (Northern Virginia)
- Secondary: UE Region (Ireland)
