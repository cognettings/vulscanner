All our infrastructure is decentralized,
meaning that we have independent data centers
spread across multiple regions.
No hardware maintenance or updates are needed
as these are carried out by a third party.
Our [platform's](https://app.fluidattacks.com/)
database does not need to be updated
as new releases are immediately used
and are always backward-compatible.
No local networks are used.
We only use Wi-Fi connections
with SSO authentication
based on our IAM
and with the sole purpose of accessing the Internet.
Connections are always encrypted
[using WPA2-AES](/criteria/requirements/252).
