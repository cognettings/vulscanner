## What information is needed in order to provide a price estimate?

To provide a price estimate, we
need to determine the objective
of the evaluation, which we refer
to as the scope.
Therefore, we require the
following information depending
on the plan you choose.

### Continuous Hacking with Machine Plan

- How many applications or groups
  will be included in the security test?

- What programming languages does
  the application have?

### Continuous Hacking with Squad Plan

- How many applications or groups
  will be included in the security
  test?

- How many developers are working
  on the clientâ€™s application?

- How many LOC are included
  within the scope?

The Health Check service requires
the client to provide us with how
many LOC are developed.
We recommend using Tokei to carry
on the [quantification of LOC](/about/faq/estimation#quantification-of-loc).

### Quantification of LOC
