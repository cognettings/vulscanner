## Is it possible to schedule follow-up meetings?

Yes.
All applications covered by the contract
for [Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/)
are assigned to a specific project leader
who is available to attend all necessary meetings.
We simply require sufficient notice
of an impending meeting
in order to schedule availability.

## Does the Squad Plan generate reports?

Through our [platform](https://fluidattacks.com/categories/arm/),
we generate and deliver a technical report
available in Excel and/or PDF format
during the execution of the project contract.
Once the project ends,
the platform delivers a presentation
and an executive report,
also in PDF format.

## How can I communicate with you?

For the Squad Plan,
communication takes place
between developers and hackers
on a day-to-day basis
via our platform.

## How long does it take you to answer a question in the comment system?

All questions made
through the vulnerabilities comment system
have a **four business hours SLA**.
M - F from 8 AM to 12 noon
and 2 PM to 6 PM
(Colombian time, UTC-5).
SLA is not contractually defined;
it is our value promise.

## Will you make presentations periodically via teleconference?

Yes, we can.
To set up a teleconference presentation,
you will need to provide us
with the emails of attendees
and **three options** of **1-hour time slots**
for the teleconference.
We will then confirm
the best time for the teleconference
based on your availability and ours
and send an invitation via email
to your list of attendees.

## Do I lose my property rights if you review my source code?

No.
Reviewing your code
in no way compromises your proprietary rights
to that code.

## Who would be performing the work?

Our designated team of hackers.

## Can I see your resumes?

Yes,
you can access the LinkedIn profiles
of some members of our team
on our People page.

## What certifications do you have?

Please refer to our
[Certifications](https://fluidattacks.com/about-us/certifications/)
page for further information.

## Do you have liability insurance?

Yes,
**1M USD coverage**.
