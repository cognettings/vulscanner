## What is an active author?

An active author is a user
with access to the Git repository
who makes changes to the stored code
in the repository
during the analyzed month.

## Why is there a month 0, and how does the setup work?

Month 0 begins the test setup
and is the start of the monthly payments.
A project leader is assigned
who is responsible for managing the connection of environments,
profiling, user creation, allocation of privileges,
and all the necessary inputs
to begin the review without setbacks.

## Does the cost vary according to the scope or development phases?

Yes.
The service cost varies
depending on the number of active authors
identified within the project
each month.
