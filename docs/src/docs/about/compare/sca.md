Software composition analysis tools identify
vulnerabilities present in open-source
components implemented in the source code.

SCA tools validate licenses, analyze
vulnerabilities and map open-source packages
and libraries.

These tools cannot detect vulnerabilities
in source code or at runtime.

In this category, we present different tools
and how our offer is about them.
