Application security orchestration and correlation
tools automatically configure security applications
such as SAST, DAST, or SCA to run security testing
throughout the development environment.
In addition, ASOC tools correlate security test
results to facilitate vulnerability analysis.

ASOC tools do not detect vulnerabilities,
they actually manage the applications that
detect them and facilitate the analysis and
presentation of results of the findings.

In this category, we present different tools
and how our offer is about them.
