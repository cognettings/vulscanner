Manual penetration testing is a service done
by hackers those attack an application with
prior authorization and report the security
weaknesses or vulnerabilities they find.

Hackers use different methodologies to exploit
vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application.
They also use DAST, SAST, or SCA tools to support
them in these tasks.

In this category we present different service
providers and how our offer is about them.
