Mobile application security testing tools combine
SAST, DAST, and MPT methodologies to perform
penetration testing of mobile applications,
taking into account their target operating
system (Android, iOS), framework, or
programming language.

MAST specializes in detecting vulnerabilities
in mobile applications, following its security
standards and controls, such as OWASP MASVS
and OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks.

In this category, we present different tools
and how our offer is about them.
