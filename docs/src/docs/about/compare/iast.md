Interactive application security testing tools detect
vulnerabilities by interacting with the application
at runtime in a controlled environment.

The interactions are performed by human testers
or an automated tests.

Problems in functionality are identified as the
application is being used.

These tools cannot detect vulnerabilities
in source code or vulnerabilities present in
the packages and libraries used in the code.

In this category, we present different tools
and how our offer is about them.
