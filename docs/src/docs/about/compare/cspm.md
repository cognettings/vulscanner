Cloud security posture management tools automate
the process of preventing, detecting, and responding
to cloud infrastructure risks across the entire
infrastructure.

CSPM specializes in securing assets and reviewing
cloud infrastructure configurations to expedite
remediation.

CSPM does not detect application vulnerabilities.
