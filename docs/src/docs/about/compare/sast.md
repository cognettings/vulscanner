Static application security testing tools
analyze the application source code to
find vulnerabilities in a non-executing state.

SAST tools identify vulnerabilities in
the code that can be remediated in
the early stages of the SDLC.

These tools cannot detect vulnerabilities
at runtime or vulnerabilities present in
the packages and libraries used in the code.

In this category we present different tools
and how our service is in relation to them.
