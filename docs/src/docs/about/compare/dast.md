Dynamic application security testing tools
detect application vulnerabilities at runtime.

Simulated attacks programmed into the DAST
tools are used to detect vulnerabilities
that an attacker would find.

These tools cannot detect vulnerabilities
in the source code or packages used to
run the application.

In this category, we present different tools
and how our offer is about them.
