In order to create a **new event**,
you need to click on the **New button**
in the **Event tab.**

![New button](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669375967/docs/web/vulnerabilities/creating-an-event/new_event.png)

You will see the following pop-up window:

![pop-up window](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669376103/docs/web/vulnerabilities/creating-an-event/popup_window.png)

There you must enter or select
the requested information:

- **Root:**
  The nickname of the root where
  the analyst discovered the
  event being reported.
- **Event date:**
  The approximate date at which
  the event was discovered.
- **Type:**
  The type of event.
  You can see the different types
  by clicking [here.](/tech/platform/groups/events/#types-of-events)
- **Details:**
  A detailed description of the event.
- **Evidence images:**
  Image as supporting evidence of the event.
- **Evidence Files:**
  Files as supporting evidence of the event.
- **Affected Reattacks:**
  Impact on an ongoing reattack (Y/N).
  In case there is an impact,
  you must select the affected locations
  in the reattack so that it goes into
  the On-hold status.

After entering the information and clicking
the **Confirm button,**
the Fluid Attacks' platform will create the new event and
send an email to all Project Managers.
You can also click on the **Cancel button**
to discard the creation of the event.

## Closing an event

When a user notifies that the
event has been solved,
or analysts find out they can
now access previously blocked
targets without problems,
the event must be closed.
You can identify that an event
has a solution applied when
it is pending status.
To learn more about event statuses,
click [here.](/tech/platform/groups/events/#status-in-the-event)

![status](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669378385/docs/web/vulnerabilities/creating-an-event/status.png)

When you click on the event,
you will see that you have three
solutions to select:
**Mark as solved,**
**reject solution,**
and **edit.**

![three options](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669380423/docs/web/vulnerabilities/creating-an-event/three_options.png)

If you see that the solution
proposed by the customer is
effective and you can close
the event successfully,
click on **Mark as solved**.
A window will pop up where
you have to enter the reason
for closing the event.

![Mark as solved](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669380536/docs/web/vulnerabilities/creating-an-event/mark_solved.png)

Now,
if you check that the event was not
closed and the solution given was unsuccessful,
click on **Reject solution**.
Here you have to put observations
about why the solution was not effective.

![Observations](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669380729/docs/web/vulnerabilities/creating-an-event/observation.png)

The **edit option** can be used if you
need to change the event type.

## Update affected reattacks

With the **Update affected reattacks**
button,
you can indicate that an already
created event affects the execution
of one or more reattacks.

![Update reattacks](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669413271/docs/web/vulnerabilities/creating-an-event/update_affected_reattacks.png)

When you click on it,
you will see a pop-up window where
you can select the respective event
and the reattacks that are being affected.

![Update reattacks](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669413380/docs/web/vulnerabilities/creating-an-event/event_affected.png)

By clicking on the **Confirm button,**

into a status called On hold.

this status,

you will abort the process.
