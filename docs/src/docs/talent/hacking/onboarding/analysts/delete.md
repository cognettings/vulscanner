Sometimes,
it is necessary
that a vulnerability
be removed from the Fluid Attacks' platform
for different reasons.
Nevertheless,
deleting the information
is not a good idea
in the security world,
and it is always important
to keep track of these events.
This is why in `Fluid Attacks`
we don’t delete the vulnerabilities.
Instead,
analysts can set any of them
to a “Deleted” state.

## Deleting specific vulnerabilities

When you want to delete
just one or several specific vulnerabilities
inside a certain type of vulnerability,
you need to enter the vulnerability
and click on the button **Bulk edit**
to enable the edition of vulnerabilities.

After this
you need to locate the vulnerabilities
that you want to delete
and then click on the trash icon
to the right of the window
for a pop-up to show up.

![Delete Vulnerabilities Modal](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669248544/docs/web/vulnerabilities/deleting-vulns/delete_justification.png)

Here you can select
between three options
to assign as a justification
which can be one of the following:

- **It is a duplicate:**
  The finding or vulnerability
  had been reported previously.
- **It is a false positive:**
  After a review process,
  it was determined
  that the finding or vulnerability
  was not.
- **Error while reporting:**
  Given that a vulnerability
  cannot be edited,
  this option must be selected
  if you are going to report
  another vulnerability
  that corrects it.

After this you may click on
the **Confirm** button
to complete the deletion process
or you can click on the **Cancel** button
to dismiss it.

## Deleting a type of vulnerability

Sometimes
it is also necessary to delete
a type of vulnerability
and all the individual vulnerabilities
that it contains,
in this case
you can click on the **Delete** button
that is located in the upper-right corner
of your window.

![Delete Finding Button](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1669320762/docs/web/vulnerabilities/deleting-vulns/delete_vul_button.png)

When you click on it,
the same pop-up for the deletion
of individual vulnerabilities will appear,
however this one will have one different option
to select as a justification,
the ones that appear are the following:

- **It is a duplicate**
- **It is a false positive**
- **Finding not required:**
  The report was made for a system
  that no longer exists
  or for a finished project.

After choosing the justification,
once again,
you may click on the **Proceed** button
to complete the deletion process
or you can click on the **Cancel** button
to dismiss it.
