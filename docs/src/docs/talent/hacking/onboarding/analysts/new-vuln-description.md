In this section of the type of vulnerability
we can check many characteristics about it
that give us a very good understanding
about what the vulnerability does
and what kind of risks come with it.
These characteristics are the following:

## Hacker

This field is filled automatically
with the `Fluid Attacks` e-mail address
of the analyst that created
the type of vulnerability.

## Description

A brief explanation about the vulnerability,
specifying how it is implemented
and what kind of threats come with it.
This may be filled out automatically
with the description given in the standardization sheet,
however,
in case the generic description
does not properly capture the situation
in which the vulnerability was found,
you may change this description to address this.

## Requirements

Here are specified
all the requirements
that the vulnerability breaks.
These requirements are defined by us
taking into account
many international security standards.
You can check them out
in this [link](/criteria/requirements/).

## Impacts

This is a list of actions
that become possible for an attacker
as a consequence of the vulnerability.
As they are actions,
each list must begin with a verb.

## Threat

Here we specify
who is the attacker
and what situation do they need
in order to exploit this vulnerability.
For example,
the attacker is an unauthorized internet user
with a valid session token
for the target application.

## Recommendation

Here we can add a generalized suggestion
aimed to the client
that would help them
solve the vulnerability.
