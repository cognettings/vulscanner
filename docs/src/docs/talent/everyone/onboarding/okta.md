With Okta,
we manage identity and access for the
applications we use in our daily work.
Sometimes,
we need to use exclusive applications
for our usability without requiring them
for the usability of other team members
or general users.

Typically,
we seek assistance through the support channel
to create these applications based on our needs.
However,
we encourage you to follow this guide,
where you can add the applications you
are interested in your require.
There are two ways to accomplish this:

- The first option is for the Okta application
  to recognize your username and password and save
  the application of your interest in your personal dashboard.
  Here are the steps to follow:

  - First,
    you need to click on the Okta plugin and
    then on the settings icon.

    ![settings okta](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1687367279/docs/talent/app-okta/settings_okta.png)

  - When entering the settings,
    make sure that the second option called
    **"Prompt to save apps to your Okta dashboard"**
    is enabled (if not, enable it).

    ![enable plugin](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1687367461/docs/talent/app-okta/pluging_setting.png)

  - Afterward,
    you can access the web application of your interest
    through the browser and log in with your username and password.
    When you enter the app,
    a confirmation window will appear,
    asking if you want to save the password in Okta.

    ![save password](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1687370231/docs/talent/app-okta/save_password.png)

  - After clicking the Save password button,
    you should log out of the app and sign in to the Okta dashboard.
    Your added app should now appear there.
    You can refresh the Okta dashboard page if you don't see it.

  - If you want to view information,
    edit,
    or delete the app from your dashboard,
    click on the three dots at the top right corner,
    and the following options will appear.

    ![edit or delete](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1687370651/docs/talent/app-okta/edit_remove.png)

  - **Note:** Please note that this option may not work in all cases.
    If you don't see the Save password pop-up,
    you can proceed with the following instructions we provide below.

- The second option is to create and add it from your
  Okta application dashboard.
  Here are the steps to follow:

  - Access your Okta dashboard and navigate to the
    option that says "Add apps"
    (located in the list on the left-hand side).

    ![add apps](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1687375042/docs/talent/app-okta/add_apps.png)

  - There,
    you will see the default catalog of
    applications available in Okta.
    In the search bar,
    you can enter the name of the app you want to add
    (or a related search term).

    ![search bar](https://res.cloudinary.com/fluid-attacks/image/upload/v1687375192/docs/talent/app-okta/search_bar.png)

  - Once you find it,
    select the app.
    Then,
    you can click on the "Add" button.
    Return to your Okta dashboard
    (by clicking on the "My Apps" option on the left-hand side)
    and verify that the newly selected app appears as added.

  - After this,
    you can view,
    edit,
    or delete the application as explained above
    (by clicking on the three dots that appear
    at the top right corner of the app).

Following these steps,
you can efficiently add applications that suit your needs.

If none of the steps described above worked
for you and you were unable to add the required app,
please send an email to **help@fluidattacks.com**
with a request to create the app in Okta,
specifying the following information:
app name,
URL where the login is performed in the app,
credentials (username and password),
and indicate to whom the app should be assigned.
