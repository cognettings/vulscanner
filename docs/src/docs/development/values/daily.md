The daily progress report is
sent when you want to track
your daily tasks (issues),
where you can communicate with
your teammates about the
progress of your work.
Also,
you can share difficulties
or doubts you have.

The report should be filled out
at the end of the day
if you were not able to upload at least one commit
to the production branch, that is,
if you did not have a MR
that was approved and merged.

We know that it is vital that
you are aware of how to make
a progress report,
so here we show you how to do it.

First you have to access the
[progress report](https://fluidattacks.formstack.com/forms/avance)
URL.

It will display other fields.

The following information to be filled in:

  work team you are part of;

When you fill it in,
you will fill in the field that
says **What did I do today?**
Here you put your progress
report for the day.
Next,
**What will I do tomorrow?**
You put what your tasks to be done are,
and finally,
the field
**I would need help with any difficulties**,
you put here if you are
having trouble with functions
that are not allowing you to
progress and require support
to achieve them.

When you have finished filling
out this questionnaire,
click on the **submit button**,
where this report will be sent
to your immediate supervisor.
