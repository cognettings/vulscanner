## Who we are

We are a [cybersecurity company](https://fluidattacks.com)
whose only purpose is to make the world
a safer place.

## What we do

- We perform comprehensive security testing
  over all of your assets.
- We use cutting-edge technologies
  and heavily trained **human hackers**.
- We report vulnerabilities back to you
  as accurately and quickly as possible.

The source code of the technologies used
is versioned in the [Universe repository][universe]
and is divided across many products.
We also have a [GitHub account][github_fluidattacks]
where we publish projects
that are more oriented towards the community
and less coupled to our model of business.
However,
this documentation focuses on the Universe repository.
The projects on GitHub have separate documentation
that can be found on each of the respective projects.

## Our users

We have different kinds of users,
we divide them by use case:

- **End Users**:
  They don't contribute code,
  but instead just interact with our products
  by installing them on their hosts and using the product's CLI,
  or through interacting with the product's public interface
  (an API, web interface, container image, etc).

  They are usually:

  - **Security Analysts of Fluid Attacks**:
    They usually use Sorts, Melts, and the ARM (Integrates), among others.
  - **Customers of Fluid Attacks**:
    They usually use the ARM (Integrates),
    the DevSecOps container image (Forces),
    read our blog (Airs),
    and sometimes our documentation (Docs).
  - **Community users**:
    They usually use tools like Skims in its Free and Open Source plan.

- **Developers**:
  The people who contribute code at [Universe][universe]
  and are usually hired by Fluid Attacks.
  They also contribute sometimes to our [projects on GitHub][github_fluidattacks].
