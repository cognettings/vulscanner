## Rationale

[Gitlab][GITLAB]
is the platform we use for
[developing our software][UNIVERSE].
It provides essential services like
[Git repositories](https://blog.axosoft.com/learning-git-repository/),
[Merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/index.html),
[Development planning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/plan_and_track.html),
[CI/CD][CICD],
among many others.

The main reasons why we chose
[Gitlab][GITLAB]
over other alternatives are:

1. It is [Open Source][OSS].
1. It is [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service).
1. It is a [DevOps Suite](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/10/04/devops-strategy/),
    meaning that all their technical efforts are focused on creating
    a workflow that facilitates getting high quality
    code to production as secure and fast as possible.
    Such vision is in harmony with our philosophical
    vision of
    [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development)
    and current
    [development cycle](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/).
1. It has its own
    [Continuous Integrator][CICD]
    with built-in support,
    which is essetial to our
    [development cycle](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/).
1. It has the
    [Gitlab for Open Source](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/)
    program,
    which gives unlimited
    [ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) free seats to
    [Open Source][OSS]
    projects like [ours][UNIVERSE].
1. It provides
    [Development Planning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/plan_and_track.html)
    with
    [issues][ISSUE],
    [milestones](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/milestones),
    [roadmaps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/roadmap/index.html),
    among others.
    Such features are essential for
    task prioritization and resource assignment.
1. It has highly customizable
    [permissions settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html),
    allowing to give permissions using a
    [user-based granular](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-members-permissions)
    approach.
    Publishing specific sections
    of a project using a
    [section-based granular](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-features-permissions)
    approach
    is also possible.
1. It supports
    [Two-factor Authentication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication.html).
1. It supports
    [Merge Requests][MR],
    allowing developers to open requests
    to get their changes to production.
1. It supports
    [Merge Request Approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/),
    allowing to specify a group
    of developers for reviewing and approving
    [merge requests][MR].
    In order to be able to reach production,
    developers need at least one approval
    from a user belonging to the approvers group.
    An approver cannot approve her own
    [merge requests][MR],
    everyone needs their work to be reviewed by someone else.
1. It has a very complete
    [REST API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/)
    that allows us to automatize
    processes like
    [reviewing merge requests](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/tree/f153761ee61aad37b00212e134eb8ac689e1952e/reviews),
    [rotating AWS secrets](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/tree/f153761ee61aad37b00212e134eb8ac689e1952e/makes/utils/user-rotate-keys)
    and
    [programatically cloning repositories](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/f153761ee61aad37b00212e134eb8ac689e1952e/makes/utils/git/template.sh#L35).
1. It has its own
    [Container registry](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/container_registry),
    allowing us to seamlessly store all our containers in the same place.
1. It supports
    [CI/CD schedules](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/pipeline_schedules),
    which allows us to easily run scheduled
    [jobs][JOBS].
1. It supports
    [Environments](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/environments)
    for seamlessly accessing both development and production environments.
1. It supports built-in
    [Analytics](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/value_stream_analytics)
    that provide
    [issue insights](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/insights/#/issues),
    [CI/CD analytics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/ci_cd_analytics.html),
    [merge request analytics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/merge_request_analytics.html),
    [issue analytics](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/analytics/issues_analytics),
    [repository analytics](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/graphs/master/charts),
    among others.
1. It supports many
    [ChatOps integrations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/overview.html).
    Allowing us to have an open,
    dedicated telemetry channel
    on our internal chat platform
    that recieves all types of relevant information
    from
    [Gitlab][GITLAB].
    Developers just need to keep an eye on it
    in order to know what's happening with
    [merge requests][MR],
    [issues][ISSUE],
    [failed jobs][JOBS],
    etc.
1. It supports
    [Repository Mirroring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html),
    allowing us to have a mirror
    of [our repository][UNIVERSE]
    on GitHub.
1. It supports
    [Project Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html),
    which greatly increase security and reliability on our integrations,
    as we use project-bounded instead of user-bounded tokens.
1. It supports
    [SSH Signed Commits](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/ssh_signed_commits/),
    allowing us to add an extra layer of security by ensuring that
    when someone pushes a new commit,
    that person is indeed who she claims she is.
1. It supports
    [Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/),
    a very easy way of publishing
    [static web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page).
1. It supports
    [Protected Branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html),
    an essential feature that assures
    that no one can push
    to the main production branch,
    thus forcing developers
    to reach production via
    [merge requests][MR].
1. It supports infrastructure integrations for
    [Error Tracking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html),
    [Tracing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/tracing.html),
    [Metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/prometheus_library/kubernetes.html),
    among others.
1. It supports
    [Push Rules][PUSH-RULES]
    that allow to further customize what can and cannot be pushed to the repository.
    Some examples are
    [branch naming][PUSH-RULES],
    [signed commits][PUSH-RULES],
    [secret pushing prevention](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/push_rules/push_rules.html#prevent-pushing-secrets-to-the-repository),
    among others.

## Alternatives

1. [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/):
    It did not exist at the time.
    It is not [Open Source][OSS].
1. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/):
    It is not a [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)
    solution but a source code respository.
    It did not integrate with a
    [CI/CD][CICD] solution.
1. [GitHub](https://github.com/about):
    It is not a [DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)
    solution but a source code respository.
    It did not integrate with a
    [CI/CD][CICD] solution.

## Usage

We use [Gitlab][GITLAB] for:

1. Hosting our
    [universe repository][UNIVERSE].
1. Hosting our
    [issues][ISSUES].
1. Hosting our
    [milestones](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/milestones).
1. Opening our
    [merge requests][MR].
1. Hosting our
    [containers](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/container_registry).
1. Visualizing
    [jobs][JOBS]
    and
    [pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/).

We do not use [Gitlab][GITLAB] for:

1. [Implementing it as code](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/issues/468):
    We can partially implement
    [Gitlab][GITLAB] as code
    using [Terraform](/development/stack/terraform#usage).
1. [Security scans](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/):
    We tried to implement this in the past
    but were not able due to
    low parametrization capabilities on the scans.
1. [Operations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/):
    We currently do not use a stack that
    integrates with [Gitlab][GITLAB].
    Issues have been opened for this:
