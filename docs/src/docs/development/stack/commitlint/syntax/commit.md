## Syntax

Valid commit messages
have the structure:

```markup
[product]\[type]([scope]): #[issue-number] [title] // This is the commit title
               // This blank line separates the commit title from the commit body
[body]         // This is the commit body. It CAN have multiple lines
```

- **[variable]** are **required** variables
  that must be replaced
  in a final commit message
  (**[]** symbols must be removed)
- **// Comment** are comments
  that must be removed
  in a final commit message

## Rules

The following rules must be met
for a commit message to be valid:

1. **[product]** variable has to be
   one of the following,
   depending on which folder of the repository
   you are working on:

   ```markup
   all         // Runs the CI for all products
               // in case you are modifying several products at once

   airs        // Main Fluid Attacks website https://fluidattacks.com
   common      // Infrastructure resources and utilities for all products
   docs        // This documentation site https://docs.fluidattacks.com
   integrates  // Fluid Attacks platform https://app.fluidattacks.com
   melts       // CLI tool to help hackers automate some processes
   observes    // ETL suites to centralize information and enable analytics
   skims       // Automatic vulnerability scanner
   sorts       // Machine Learning tool to prioritize security analysis in Git
   teaches     // Resources to teach infrastructure in the Cloud
   ```

   If you are working on a file
   in the root of the repository,
   outside all of these folders,
   use `common`.

1. **[type]** variable has to be
   one of the following:

   ```markup
   rever  // Revert to a previous commit in history
   feat   // New feature
   perf   // Improves performance
   fix    // Bug fix
   refac  // Neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
   test   // Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   style  // Do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc)
   sol    // Hacking solution only for writepus and training repo
   ```

1. **[scope]** variable has to be
   one of the following:

   ```markup
   front  // Front-End change
   back   // Back-End change
   infra  // Infrastructure change
   conf   // Configuration files change
   build  // Build system, CI, compilers, etc (scons, webpack...)
   job    // asynchronous or schedule tasks (backups, maintenance...)
   cross  // Mix of two or more scopes
   doc    // Documentation only changes
   vbd    // Vulnerable by design hacking solution only for writeups repo
   code   // Programming challenge solution only for training repo
   hack   // ctf-hacking challenge solution only for training repo
   ```

1. A **Commit title**
   must exist.

1. A **Commit title**
   must **not** contain
   the '**:**' character.

1. **Commit title**
   must have 60 characters
   or less.

1. **Commit title**
   must be lower case.

1. **Commit title**
   must not finish
   with a dot '**.**'.

1. **Commit title**
   must reference
   an issue.

1. **Commit title**
   must be meaningful.
   Avoid using things like
   `feat(build)[integrates]: #5 feature`.

1. If **commit title**
   has **sol** type,
   it must reference
   issue **#0**.

1. A **blank line**
   between commit title
   and commit body
   must exist.

1. A **commit body**
   must exist.

1. Lines in **commit body**
   must have 72 characters
   or less.

1. If **commit title**
   has **fix** type
   and the fix comes from another commit,
   the body must reference
   the commit sha of the bug
   in the format
   `- commit: $COMMIT_SHA`
   (the full version of sha 40 with characters),
   If the fix is not related to a specific commit,
   use `- commit: N/A` instead.

### Possible combinations

Below is a table explaining
all the possible combinations
between types and scopes
for a commit message

Where:

- **perf** is performance.
- **infra** is infrastructure.

- **NA** is not applicable.

## Recommendations

- Try to itemize your commit body:

  ```text
  - Add feature X in file Y
  - Run script Z
  - Remove file A with B purpose
  ```

## Example

Here is an example
of a compliant commit message:

```markup
integrates\feat(build): #13 add type_check

- Add type_check function
- Remove unnecessary print_output function
```
