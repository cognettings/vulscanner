## Rationale

[AWS KMS][KMS] is the service we use for storing
and using cryptographic keys.
It allows us to have non-readable
symmetric and asymmetric private keys
hosted in the [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing).

The main reasons why we chose it over other alternatives are the following:

- It [integrates](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration)
  with other [AWS][AWS] services
  like [DynamoDB](/development/stack/aws/dynamodb/introduction/),
  [EKS](/development/stack/aws/eks/),
  [S3](/development/stack/aws/s3/),
  [EBS][EBS],
  among others.
- It uses a state-of-the-art approach
  for both encryption and decryption
  in which keys are never exposed.
  It accomplishes this
  by making users send the data they want to encrypt/decrypt
  and then returning it
  encrypted/decrypted.
  By doing so,
  keys never leave [KMS][KMS].
  This approach greatly reduces
  the chances of key leakage,
  as plaintext keys can only be obtained via [brute-force attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack).
- It complies with [several](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/iso-certified/)
  certifications from [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization)
  and [CSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Security_Alliance).
  Many of these certifications are focused on granting
  that the entity follows best practices
  regarding secure cloud-based environments
  and information security.
- It uses [hardware security modules](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/#Secure)
  validated under [FIPS 140-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2)
  so that no one can retrieve the existent keys.
  Such keys are never written to disk
  and only exist within volatile memory
  for the time needed to process requests.
- It provides a centralized key vault
  with complete [API support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html)
  where you can store both [AWS and customer managed keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html),
  [rotate them](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html),
  [log and monitor them](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/security-logging-monitoring.html),
  [set deleting waiting periods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html#deleting-keys-how-it-works),
  etc.
- It supports a [fully granular](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/control-access-overview.html)
  authentication and access control model,
  where each key has a policy
  that specifies what actions users can execute.
  Additionally,
  when combined with [AWS IAM](/development/stack/aws/iam/),
  it allows us to specify permissions
  over general actions like creating keys.
- Keys and permissions can be [written as code](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/6416b9035e089b575336c3ba074ff5fd39575306/makes/applications/makes/secrets/src/terraform/key-production.tf)
  using [Terraform](/development/stack/terraform/).
- It integrates with [Sops](/development/stack/sops/),
  allowing us to use its keys
  for encrypting our versioned secrets.

## Alternatives

- **[Google Cloud Key Management](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management):**
  It did not exist at the time we migrated to the cloud.
  It does not integrate with other [AWS][AWS] services,
  meaning that an entire platform migration would be required.
- **[Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/):**
  It did not exist at the time we migrated to the cloud.
  It does not integrate with other AWS services,
  meaning that an entire platform migration would be required.

## Usage

We use [AWS KMS][KMS] for

- [DynamoDB Encryption at rest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/dynamodb_table#server_side_encryption);
- [S3 server-side encryption](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/a089fc93ce78b5a073a9ef35c46ec59f7d622e2c/airs/deploy/production/terraform/bucket.tf#L5);
- [encrypting and decrypting](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/a089fc93ce78b5a073a9ef35c46ec59f7d622e2c/makes/applications/makes/secrets/src/production.yaml#L14)
  our [Sops](/development/stack/sops/) secrets;
- [encrypting and decrypting](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/a089fc93ce78b5a073a9ef35c46ec59f7d622e2c/makes/applications/makes/k8s/src/terraform/cluster.tf#L42)
  our [Kubernetes](/development/stack/kubernetes) workers
  [EBS][EBS] disks;
- encrypting and decrypting our [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning)
  data EBS disk;
- encrypting and decrypting our [Okta RADIUS](/development/stack/okta#usage)
  Agent EBS disk.

We do not use AWS KMS for

- [Redshift](/development/stack/aws/redshift/)
  (the database is not encrypted at rest; this implementation is pending);
- [CI Bastion](/development/stack/gitlab-ci/)
  (it does not use EBS encrypted disks,
  since only the base [operating system][OS]
  and other minor dependencies
  are stored there, as described
  [here][EBS-USAGE]);
- [CI workers](/development/stack/gitlab-ci/)
  (they do not use EBS encrypted disks,
  since only the base operating system is stored there,
  as described [here][EBS-USAGE]);
- [Batch workers](/development/stack/aws/batch/)
  (they do not use EBS encrypted disks,
  since only the base operating system is stored there,
  as described [here][EBS-USAGE]).

## Guidelines

- You can access the [AWS KMS][KMS] console
  after [authenticating on AWS](/development/stack/aws#guidelines).
- Any changes to KMS infrastructure must be done via [merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/).
- To learn how to test and apply infrastructure via [Terraform](/development/stack/terraform),
  visit the [Terraform Guidelines](/development/stack/terraform#guidelines).
