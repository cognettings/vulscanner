## Rationale

We use [AWS VPC][vpc] for hosting
our own private network
in the [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing).
It allows us to manage network configurations like
[subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html),
[IP addressing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html),
[Internet gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html),
[Routing tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html),
[Security groups][security-groups],
among others.

The main reasons why we chose it
over other alternatives are:

1. It is a core [AWS](/development/stack/aws/)
   service,
   which means that in order to be able to
   use other [AWS](/development/stack/aws/) services
   that rely on networking,
   one must use [VPC][vpc].
1. It integrates with services that use
   networking-dependant infrastructure like
   [EC2](/development/stack/aws/ec2/),
   [Elastic Load Balancing](/development/stack/aws/elb/),
   [AWS Redshift](/development/stack/aws/redshift/),
   etc.
1. It complies with [several](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/iso-certified/)
   certifications from
   [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization)
   and
   [CSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Security_Alliance).
   Many of these certifications
   are focused on granting that the entity
   follows best practices regarding secure
   [cloud-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) environments
   and information security.
1. It supports [Subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html#vpc-subnet-basics),
   which allows to have multiple network segments,
   each of them existing in a separate
   [availability zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html),
   granting [network redundancy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)>).
1. It supports [Security groups][security-groups]
   that allow to specify inbound and outbound rules for
   [network interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html).
   Such rules can be based on other
   [security groups][security-groups],
   [IP segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address),
   and [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol).
1. It supports [Internet gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html)
   that provide [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)
   to machines with
   [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) access.
1. It supports [Routing tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html),
   allowing to customize routing inside the network.
1. It supports [DHCP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html),
   allowing to easily assign private
   [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)
   to machines as they are created.
1. Resources can be
   [written as code](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket)
   using
   [Terraform](/development/stack/terraform/).

## Alternatives

1. [Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/):
   It provides a more [SaaS-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service)
   approach to networking.
   Configuring networks is easier,
   but also less parametrizable.
1. [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/virtual-network/):
   It did not exist at the time we migrated to the cloud.
   Pending to review.

## Usage

We use [VPC][vpc] for setting
networking and security configurations for:

1. [EC2](/development/stack/aws/ec2/) machines.
1. [Kubernetes cluster](/development/stack/kubernetes/) workers.
1. [Batch](/development/stack/aws/batch/) workers.
1. [Elastic Load Balancing](/development/stack/aws/elb/)
   load balancers.

## Guidelines

1. You can access the
   [AWS VPC][vpc] console
   after [authenticating on AWS](/development/stack/aws#guidelines).
1. Any changes to
   [VPC's][vpc]
   infrastructure must be done via
   [Merge Requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/)
   by modifying its
   [Terraform module](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/tree/1aa1cbe233dcd683d372df6ed547c899a7ba0168/makes/applications/makes/vpc/src/terraform).

   [Terraform Guidelines](/development/stack/terraform#guidelines).
