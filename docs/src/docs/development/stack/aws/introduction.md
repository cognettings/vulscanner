## Rationale

[AWS][aws] is our main [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service)
cloud provider.
The main reasons why we chose it
over other alternatives
are the following:

- It provides a highly granular approach to [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service),
  offering over [one hundred independent services][aws]
  that range from [quantum computing](https://aws.amazon.com/braket)
  to [servers for videogames](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift).
- It has a fully granular
  [pay-as-you-go](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing)
  pricing model,
  which allows us to pay exactly
  for what we are using.
- It complies with
  many global [top security standards](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/).
- It has a [highly redundant infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/?hp=tile&tile=map)
  distributed across the world,
  making us feel comfortable
  when it comes to its [availability and reliability](https://status.aws.amazon.com/).
- It is a cloud infrastructure leader,
  [according to Gartner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/top-10-cloud-service-providers/).
- It is the [oldest cloud provider](https://www.techaheadcorp.com/blog/top-cloud-service-providers/#:~:text=Since%20AWS%20is%20the%20oldest,recently%20launched%20AWS%20Storage%20Gateway.).

## Alternatives

[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)
is an alternative
that did not exist at the time we migrated to the cloud.
Its service catalog is much smaller,
which means less flexibility.
