The following patterns
were chosen following the best
[DynamoDB practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-relational-modeling.html)
and with the business needs in mind.
Some are for standardization
among all the application

- Attribute names have no relationship
    to attribute values.
- Store date-like data as integers,
    for easy comparison.
- Automatic UUID generation for ids.
    When the attribute must have an id
    (this is not applicable to available_groups
    since it is a simple string value),
    it should be an uuid4.
- According to
    [official documentation](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=93743)
    the latency of a `get_item` vs a `query limit=1`
    will be equivalent.
    So it is better to have always
    both range and sort key
    for every table and GSI.
- Use hierarchical relationships:
    group attributes will have an attribute,
    which is a sort key,
    with the following structure:
    ORG_ID#TYPE#STATUS.
    With this,
    it is easy to search for groups within a company,
    with a certain type in a given status,
    and everything in between,
    since a sort key can be searched partially.

Calculations for
[`write sharding`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-modeling-nosql-B.html):

```markup
ItemsPerRCU = 4KB / AvgItemSize

PartitionMaxReadRate = 3K * ItemsPerRCU

N = MaxRequiredIO / PartitionMaxReadRate
```

For groups.
Get active and suspended groups.
This query is important
for forces executions:

```markup
10000 projected groups (more than fi_projects + fi_project_names) in the following 5 years
Currently, there are 594 projects, with a total size of 1.55MB (1'550.000 bytes)
At least 30% will be active-suspended, so:
MaxRequiredIO = 0.3 * 10000 = 3000
2609 bytes per item
ItemsPerRCU = 4KB / 2.6KB = 1,54
PartitionMaxReadRate = 3000 * 1,54 = 4.6K
N = 3000 / 4.6K = 0,65
```

Given the latter,
there is no need to write
sharding in groups items
