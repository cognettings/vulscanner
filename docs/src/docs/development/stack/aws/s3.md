## Rationale

[AWS S3][S3]
is the service we use for
[storing files in the cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage).

The main reasons why we chose it
over other alternatives are:

1. It is
    [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service)
    oriented,
    meaning that
    in order to start storing data,
    we only need to
    create a
    [bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html).
    We do not have to worry about
    storage space,
    [infrastructure scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability),
    [data availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability),
    [data persistence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)),
    among many other infrastructure-related concerns.
1. It complies with [several](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/iso-certified/)
    certifications from
    [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization)
    and
    [CSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Security_Alliance).
    Many of these certifications
    are focused on granting that the entity
    follows best practices regarding secure
    [cloud-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) environments
    and information security.
1. Resources can be
    [written as code](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket)
    using
    [Terraform][TERRAFORM].
1. It supports
    [static website hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html),
    allowing us to easily host sites like
    [our website](https://fluidattacks.com)
    and
    [our documentation](https://docs.fluidattacks.com).
1. Its
    [static website hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html)
    provides
    [direct endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteEndpoints.html),
    meaning that dealing with
    [load balancers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing))
    and static
    [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)
    is not required
    in order to expose a site
    to the
    [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet).
1. It can be
    [easily integrated](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/tree/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/docs/infra/terraform)
    with
    [Cloudflare](/development/stack/cloudflare),
    allowing us to implement
    [DNS](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/docs/infra/terraform/dns.tf#L3),
    [edge cache](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/docs/infra/terraform/cache.tf),
    [Redirections](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/docs/infra/terraform/dns.tf#L21),
    [Security headers](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/docs/infra/terraform/headers.tf),
    among many other
    [Cloudflare](/development/stack/cloudflare)
    features.
1. It supports
    [presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html)
    that can be used
    for creating signed download links
    that can only be accessed by the user
    with the generated key.
    Such links can have
    an
    [expiration date](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/integrates/back/src/s3/operations.py#L93).
    This feature greatly reduces the chance
    of data leaks.
1. It supports
    [versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/manage-versioning-examples.html),
    allowing us to keep a complete historic of all stored objects.
1. It supports
    [storage lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html),
    allowing to
    [declare policies](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/skims/infra/s3_data.tf#L10)
    for expiring files
    and moving them to
    different
    [storage classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html).
1. It can be
    programatically accessed
    using the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/)
    and other language-specific
    libraries like
    [Python's Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html),
    allowing us to
    [connect our applications](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/integrates/back/src/s3/operations.py)
    to it.
1. It can be used by [Terraform][TERRAFORM]
    as a
    [backend to store its state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html).
1. It supports
    [AES256 server-side-encryption](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/skims/infra/s3_data.tf#L25).
1. It supports
    [access control lists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html)
    with an object-level granularity,
    allowing to have full control
    regarding object access privileges.
1. It supports
    [bucket policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-policies.html),
    which are specially useful
    when making a
    [bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html)
    only [accessible from a CDN](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/blob/56683d3cfbc2b1be3ebe8ae6dd4627b066961aa9/docs/infra/terraform/bucket.tf#L31)
    in order to avoid
    [CDN bypassing](https://opendatasecurity.co.uk/how-to-bypass-cdn/).
1. It supports
    [Storage Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens.html),
    an analytics module for visualizing
    insights and trends
    and optimizing usage.

## Alternatives

1. [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage):
    It did not exist at the time we migrated to the cloud.
    It does not provide
    [direct endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteEndpoints.html),
    meaning that
    [load balancers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing))
    and static
    [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)
    are needed
    in order to expose a site
    to the
    [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet).
1. [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/storage/blobs/):
    It did not exist at the time we migrated to the cloud.
    Pending to review.
