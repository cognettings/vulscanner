## What role can I use on LinkedIn?

Starting from October 24th, 2022.

can decide on the title and job description/duties

certification and recommendation letters,
and any other mechanisms where this information may be important.

There are no conditions.
The decision on what title or job description/duties a person use
is made individually by each person's judgment.
Please try to make it relevant,
but feel free to word it in the way that's most convenient for you.

Should you wish or need a certification,
the Human Resources department
or the corresponding authority at Fluid Attacks
will sign the letter you write, as you wrote it,
or they'll make one including the details and exact words
that you voluntarily chose to include.
