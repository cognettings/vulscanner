* **GQ01:** We *must* use straight quotation marks and apostrophes
  (e.g., "I'll do this"), not curved ones (e.g., “I won’t do this”).

* **GQ02:** We *must* use quotation marks
  to enclose and represent exact words that come from someone else.

* **GQ03:** We *must* place the periods and commas
  before the final quotation marks.
  On the contrary, we *must* put the colons and semicolons
  after the final quotation marks.
  If exclamation and question marks are not part of a quotation,
  we *must* place them outside the quotation marks.

* **GQ04:** We *must* use single quotation marks ('...')
  to enclose quotations within other quotations
  (e.g., The doctor told me, "When I interviewed the patient,
  she simply said 'I didn't see anything.'").

* **GQ05:** We *must* use quotation marks for titles of songs,
  short stories, essays, newspaper and magazine articles,
  blog posts and other similar online publications,
  poems, chapters of books and episodes of TV series and radio programs.

* **GQ06:** We *can* use quotation marks
  to indicate words with irony, skepticism or a certain reserve
  (e.g., The team's "great effort"
  has meant being eliminated from the main league.).

* **GQ07:** When we want to remove an unnecessary fragment from a quotation,
  we *must* use ellipsis in square brackets as a substitute
  (e.g., ["The biggest thing](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/tribe-of-hackers-4/)
  is to go through the attack methodology
  and show what worked [...] and what did not work in the attack.").

* **GQ08:** When we need to modify a fragment of a quotation,
  for instance, to adjust the sentence tense,
  we *must* put the new words in square brackets
  (e.g., ["This [was] very controversial](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/apple-data-center-china/)
  given the calls of different organizations and human rights defenders.").

* **GQ09:** We *must* separate the quotation
  as an independent paragraph with a different style
  (using the blockquote symbol (`>`) in Markdown)
  and without quotation marks
  when it is longer than **40 words**.
  However, we *can* do this also with shorter quotations
  when we want to give them some emphasis.
