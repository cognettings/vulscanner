* **GC01:** We *must* capitalize (a) the first word of a sentence,
  (b) the pronoun (e.g., *I*), (c) proper nouns
  (i.e., the names of specific people, organizations,
  places and sometimes things),
  (d) professional titles preceding people's names
  (e.g., Dr. Dawkins),
  (e) the days of the week, holidays and the months of the year,
  (f) nationalities and specific languages,
  (g) members of social, national, political,
  civic, racial and athletic groups (e.g., Democrats),
  (h) periods and events (e.g., Great Depression),
  and (i) trademarks.

* **GC02:** We *must* present the names of our solutions and services
  with initial capital letters (e.g., [Continuous Hacking](https://fluidattacks.com/services/continuous-hacking/)).

* **GC03:** We *must* use initial capital letters
  in the titles of blog posts and other pages
  and the titles of sections and subsections of the documentation
  ([following APA standards](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/APA/)),
  *not* in the internal subtitles.
  For our platform, when section names,
  column names, subtitles and table items have two or more words, only the first
  one should be capitalized (i.e., Attack vector, Open vulnerabilities)

* **GC04:** We *must not* use sustained capital letters
  to emphasize a word or phrase,
  nor combine them with bold or italics.

* **GC05:** We *must* capitalize the first letter of a quote
  when it is a complete sentence
  (e.g., [...\] [as Cimpanu in The Record says](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/facebook-data-leak/),
  "While the forum is publicly accessible [...]."),
  as opposed to when it is only a sentence fragment
  (e.g., [...\] [that's why people say](https://fluidattacks.com/blog/facebook-data-leak/)
  it's "free data" in almost all the sources I checked.).
  When the quote is interrupted,
  we *must* begin its second part with a lowercase letter
  (e.g., "I did not want to commit this crime," said Mr. Allen,
  "but an internal force compelled me to do it.").

  > **NOTE:**
  > In Markdown, in cases like the first two examples in GC05,
  > we must use the backslash before the first closing square bracket
  > to get the intended hyperlink:
