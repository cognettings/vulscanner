* **GB01:** We *can* use bold to highlight important keywords or phrases.

* **GB02:** We *must not* use bold too often in a block of text
  to allow the highlighted elements to really stand out.

* **GB03:** We *must not* emphasize entire paragraphs in bold.

* **GB04:** If we have already emphasized
  an important word or phrase within a text,
  we *should* preferably *not* emphasize it there again.

* **GB05:** We *must not* use bold and italics in the same emphasis
  (e.g., ***bold-italics***).
