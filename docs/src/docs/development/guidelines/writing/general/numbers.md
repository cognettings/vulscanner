* **GN01:** We *must not* put numbers in parentheses
  after they have already been mentioned (e.g., five (5)).

* **GN02:** We *must* use words to express numbers below 10,
  *unless* the numbers precede a unit of measurement (e.g., 4.52 cm),
  they are part of statistical or mathematical operations
  (e.g., 5% of the participants; divided by 8),
  or they denote dates, exact amounts of money,
  specific places in numbered series, parts of books and tables,
  or each number in a list of four or more digits.

* **GN03:** We *must* express in words
  numbers at the beginning of a sentence or a title
  (e.g., Fourteen participants were in the control group)
  and common fractions and phrases
  (e.g., Three-fourths of the population).

* **GN04:** We *must* separate the integer parts of decimal numbers
  from their fractional parts
  using decimal points, not commas.

* **GN05:** We *must* place a zero before a decimal fraction less than 1
  if the statistic can exceed 1 (e.g., 0.49 in);
  otherwise, the zero is not necessary (e.g., *p* = .93).

* **GN06:** For numbers over 1,000,
  we *must* use the comma to separate groups of three digits
  except for page numbers, binary code, serial numbers, temperatures,
  acoustic frequencies and degrees of freedom.

* **GN07:** We *must not* add apostrophes
  when we write a plural of a number (e.g., the 90's).

* **GN08:** When one number follows another in a sentence,
  we *should* mix numbers with words (e.g., 4 three-year-old dogs),
  but, in some cases, the wording may be modified for clarity.

* **GN09:** We *must not* use the superscript
  for ordinal numbers (e.g., 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>).

* **GN10:** When we are presenting values with decimal numbers in a text,
  we *must not* give the values of the same variable
  with a different number of decimals.

* **GN11:** We *must* use words instead of mathematical symbols
  (e.g., plus, equal) in narrative texts.

* **GN12:** We *must* use spaces between elements in mathematical expressions
  to facilitate reading (e.g., a Ã— -b = c;
  here, the minus sign is not separated from the *b*
  because it represents its negative value).

* **GN13:** When we talk about values of millions and billions,
  we *should* use the abbreviations M and B, respectively (e.g., $15.4M).
  We *must not* express the whole number unless strictly necessary,
  for example, for some kind of analysis.
