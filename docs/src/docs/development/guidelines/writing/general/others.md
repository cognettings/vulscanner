* **GO01:** We *must* use colons
  when we make it clear that we are going to present a list
  or as substitutes for *it is*, *they are* or similar expressions
  (e.g., (a) These are currently the best teams in the Premier League:
  Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea.
  (b) There is only one thing to do: buy food supplies asap.).

* **GO02:** After the colon, we *must* write the first word in lower case
  (unless it is a word that, as a proper noun,
  must begin with a capital letter)
  if, together with the other words,
  it forms a [dependent clause](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/dependent_clause.htm)
  or incomplete sentence
  or if it is part of a list or series of words.
  Otherwise, it *must* begin with a capital letter
  (e.g., (a) We want to thank all of you:
  clients, community, hackers, developers, partners and providers.
  (b) Meta-description: We offer you our platform
  for continuous monitoring of your digital assets.).

* **GO03:** We *must* not repeat punctuation marks
  (e.g., exclamation marks!!) to emphasize a word or phrase.

* **GO04:** We *must* use the monospace font
  only when referring to the name of our company (i.e., `Fluid Attacks`)
  and when displaying any code-related elements
  (e.g., commands, functions) within our texts.

* **GO05:** We *must not* leave loose sentences in texts without periods
  (unlike what happens with dependent clauses and simple terms
  in [lists](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/development/writing/general/lists)).

* **GO06:** We *must* present disjunctions in ordinary texts
  with the word *or*, not with symbols (e.g., */*).

* **GO07:** We *must* present conjunctions in ordinary texts
  with the word *and*, not with symbols (e.g., *&*).

* **GO08:** We *must* write an acronym and its meaning together
  (e.g., From the beginning our your software development lifecycle (SDLC).)
  only the first time we mention one of them in a subsection,
  page or blog post
  (not in titles or subtitles).
  After that,
  we *should* use only the acronym.

* **GO09:** We *must not* put periods at the end of titles and subtitles.
