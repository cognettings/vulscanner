* **GM01:** *All* the information we display in our documentation and website
  *must* be written in the **English language**.

* **GM02:** We *must* be clear, concise and direct in our writing.

* **GM03:** We *must not* copy and publish other people's texts
  without referencing their source.
  Besides, we *must* show originality in our writings.

* **GM04:** We *must* avoid unnecessary repetition of information in our texts.

* **GM05:** We *must* keep the names of our services, solutions and material
  updated in each of our publications
  (e.g., if our main application receives the name Fluid Attacks' platform
  and not Integrates,
  we must present it that way in all our writings).

* **GM06:** We *must* be consistent with the handling of our key terms
  in each of the sections (i.e., within the documentation),
  pages and blog posts
  (e.g., use "reattacks" all the time and not sometimes "re-attacks").

* **GM07:** We *must not* close any block of text
  of the sections and pages
  with *goodbye* or any similar expression
  (it is different in blog posts).

* **GM08:** We *should* seek to present our ideas mainly in the active voice,
  that is, making it clear to the reader
  who is the subject in charge of each action
  (e.g., passive voice:
  "These security standards are implemented in our daily activities."
  Active voice:
  "We implement these security standards in our daily activities.").

* **GM09:** We *must* be careful with the characters
  that generate an effect on the written material (i.e., inline markup)
  and make the necessary changes when transferring information
  from [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org/)
  to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or vice versa.

* **GM10:** We *must* take the time, after writing a text,
  to carefully check for spelling mistakes.
  Once published, on the next day, for example,
  we can invest some more time in another quick revision
  and make any necessary adjustments.
