* **GL01:** We *must* use bullet points for lists
  that do not communicate a hierarchical order
  and numbers (starting with 1, 2, 3...) for those that do.

* **GL02:** We *must* place periods at the end of list items
  (except for lists that are paragraph divisions)
  when what we are listing are complete sentences
  or [independent clauses](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/independent_clause.htm).

* **GL03:** When we split a paragraph into a list,
  we *must not* put a colon before the first item.
  Each line *must* be in a bullet point
  beginning with a lowercase letter
  and *must* end with a semicolon,
  except for the last line,
  which *must* have a period
  (the penultimate line can also end with a comma
  followed by the conjunction *and*).

* **GL04:** We *can* also display lists in paragraphs
  (without bullet points)
  using letters in parentheses
  (e.g., These emails contain information on
  (a) what data was leaked or compromised,
  (b) when the data was...).

* **GL05:** When all the items in a list begin with one or more words
  followed by a colon and more information,
  we *must* emphasize those first words and the colon in bold.

* **GL06:** We *must* avoid that details expressed in the sentences
  previous to the lists
  be repeated in the items of the lists.

* **GL07:** We *must not* use numbers or bullet points
  for words or sentences that stand alone within a subsection,
  page or blog post,
  as if they were part of a list.
