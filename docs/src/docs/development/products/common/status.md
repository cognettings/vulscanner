## Public Oath

1. The status page is available at
   [status.fluidattacks.com](https://status.fluidattacks.com).

## Architecture

1. Status is a monitoring service
   powered by [Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com).
1. We define checks over different endpoints:
   - Airs: A web-browser based check
     that verifies our home page loads,
     and contains the company name.
   - Docs: A web-browser based check
     that verifies our documentation loads,
     and contains a title.
   - Fluid Attacks' platform: A web-browser based check
     that verifies Fluid Attacks' platform (integrates) loads,
     and contains a title.
   - API: An authenticated GraphQL query to Fluid Attacks' platform
     API  (integrates),
     that verifies that the response body
     contains the expected information.
1. A dashboard is publicly accessible
   and aggregates the checks results
   and displays availability metrics over time.
1. When a check fails,
   some users receive an alert by SMS or Email.
