This section contains everything regarding testing for Integrates'
backend. It explains the types of tests that are used and why we
use them. We run the following tests:

- **Unit tests**: Individually test functions or methods and classes.

- **Functional tests:**
  These tests are focused on the application's business requirements,
  where the result of an action is verified,
  aiming to validate that many integrated functionalities work
  as a whole and perform the execution.
