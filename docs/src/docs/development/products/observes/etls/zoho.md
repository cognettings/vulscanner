This ETL process extracts data from the Zoho CRM api and sends it to
the warehouse (redshift).

:::note
Local execution and sending of jobs will require to
[setup your terminal](/talent/engineering/onboarding#terminal)
and have access to the
`prod_observes` role and the `CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Architecture

- Prepare

  The ETL request export data on batch jobs through the zoho API. It saves
  the job id on redshift for future retrieval. Job is triggered by an
  schedule; local execution can be done with:

  ```bash
  m . /observes/etl/zoho-crm/fluid
  ```

- Core

  This is the core ETL process which downloads the results of the previously
  requested data.

  ```bash
  m . /observes/etl/zoho-crm/fluid/prepare
  ```

## Common issues

Sometimes the ETL cannot continue normally

### expired bulk data

- Reason: [#5441](https://gitlab.com/fluidattacks/universe/-/issues/5441)

- Resolution: delete bulk_jobs state and retry prepare and core procedures

  ```sql
  delete from zoho_crm.bulk_jobs
  ```
